"Bought an F150 here recently. They make good promises to your face and don't follow through. 
1st- Gas Gauge isnt working and I discovered that the day I drove off the lot, they wont go good for fixing it

2nd- put in our bill of sale I wanted the missing hubcaps. Still waiting over a month later (yes ive been checking in)

3rd - Hubcaps are bent out and when I looked to decide I was going to replace them the techs put the wheel weights ON the hubcaps... Real S-M-R-T 

Don't waste your time here unless you're looking for that greasy-sleezy used car sales experienceI was Approved for financing!!! and I got the car I wanted plus tires!!!! Thank you Barry for you hard work! I know I was a pain in the Butt but hey at least I got your printer working again Barry was a great sales person! Even though we didn't get what we asked for an were approved the site down and talk with him was great! Even though the mix up happened I'd honesty have to say that they got us am approval pretty darn quickly for what we wanted! And Barry thanks for trying to help me find the yogurt bunny too :) ❤️",residential
"In the past month, we've been in to the store 3 times to use the print and copy services at this location. Each time there has been an issue with attachments not working or the files being too big for the print me app that an employee had to help us each time. Thankfully for us that super helpful employee was Dru! Dru, you saved us so much time and frustration; thank you so so much for all your help, knowledge and friendly service. I was so happy to see that you were working the second and third times we visited the store because I knew we would have everything done quickly, efficiently and from someone who has great customer service.Frustrating experience at Staples today. I’m not a regular customer so I’m not super familiar with their print services but as a designated Purolator drop-off location, I will occasionally drop packages there. During a previous visit, I was told how to email a label for printing. I completed this step prior to arriving to expedite the process. 

There was a line when I arrived with 2 people in front of me and several people followed behind me. At one point, the gentleman behind the counter asked me to wait at the shipping counter if I had a parcel. He called over for extra help and the other associate proceeded to help everyone in line but me. Benefit of the doubt - maybe the other associate didn’t know how to do shipping? Fair enough. 

When the first associate finally came over, I was told that I should be printing the label myself. I explained that on a previous visit the associate looked after that part but I was happy to learn for future visits if he could show me. He said he could show me if I “want to wait behind everyone else in line”. I didn’t get upset but I must’ve said something sarcastic because he finally decided to be helpful and printed the label I had prepared ahead of time.

Now, I fully understand retail and that the store doesn’t technically make any money from Purolator and FedEx drop-offs. And maybe the staff have been told not to give any priority or proper customer service to their shipping customers. I would think Purolator and FedEx would be interested in knowing this if that were the case. 

End of the day, my parcel got shipped (or will be, I guess) but I’m no further ahead in my understanding of how this process works. If they want to be helpful and print labels for customers, I’m very confused at this interaction. If I’m supposed to print my own labels, I’m no further ahead after today either. So, I’m likely destined for a future experience very similar to the one I had today...Absolutely great customer service!  Went there to do some printing/copying...machine jammed up so the staffer not only made our copies for us but gave us some bonus copies for free for our trouble/inconvenience.  So great to exceed expectations and be willing to do so without any request or complaints - just did the right thing!  As businesses should!  So good!!!  Thank you Staples!!! A few days ago, I ordered an arrangement of roses from Flower Trends, for my moms birthday. She absolutely loves them! Flower Trends is my go-to flower store, for every occasion. They have the best quality flowers, of course, but what I like the most about them is they are experts at customer service and delivering value. They will go the extra mile for you, every time. Thank you Flower Trends Florists.Roxanna designed the most beautiful flower arch, bouquets and boutonnieres for our wedding this August! She was amazing to work with and really listened to what we were looking for. Thank-you so much! We loved the flowers on our wedding day.Flowers were apparently lovely and delivery very prompt. Will order again from this florist. Excellent store for the young budding reader. With sections clearly labeled to help you find the age appropriate novels for your children. Great selection of books, novels, toys and plush toys to stimulate the imagination of the children.Great selection of books, service was great.  The sales person was helpful and mentioned that they could order certain selections in if they didn't have them in store.  The toy selections was not as extensive as the books, but there were different items that I didn't see in other stores.Great service and a wide selection of items
 Books, toys, and lego to name a few. Certainly store for any adult interested in finding items to help enlighten children. When I first walked in I didn't expect much considering the past few times I got my nails done at different places they butchered them and were over priced garbage. These guys at T.A Nails know exactly what they are doing!! My nails are so shiny and smooth! The guy who did them for me was very nice as well!! I only paid 60 bucks and it was well worth it in my opinion. I WILL be going back!i would rate this place a five after going a few hours ago! The service was great and he was always asking how i was doing and telling me what he was about to proceed with. The place was VERY CLEAN and you know that because right after getting them done and dried they brush off the access and ask you to go wash your hands. (It took around 45 minutes for them to be complete) He was not one of those people who talked to the other worker the whole time or one  of those people who didnt talk at all, he started conversations when necessary and told me advice on maintaining the nails. Most of all I LOVE THEM!This place is amazing for getting nails done.the people will treat you like family, and the employees are super nice!! I found the great deal they advertised and purchased it. It was amazing.Perfect day to take the bus over! Wherever I went, I received good help in the stores. The heat outside also helped. :)The Woodlawn plaza is a good place they have the Giant tiger / Staples the bargain barn and lots of other shops there I go there a couple times a month to shop for things. I've been going here for years now, and from eye exams - to frames, lenses, and contacts they've been amazing all around. 
Great quality products and always friendly service.My 90-yr-old parents (both with dementia) didn't even buy their glasses at Vogue, but when they got broken, Vogue fixed them anyway and didn't even charge us anything!  They seemed genuinely concerned about helping out someone in need, and were just super nice people.  Needless to say, when Mom needed new glasses, we went there and they were very kind and patient with her.  These folks not only know how to provide good best customer service but how to be really decent human beings, tooWhat an amazing experience! The staff was friendly and very helpful and the prices are fantastic! I left very happy and feeling like I got a great deal on something I needed to buy. They were also able to get my glasses done very fast and were very organized and efficient. World Gym Dartmouth is an amazing gym with the best trainers and great equipment. 

I have been doing personal training there since the day it opened with Aaron McDonald. I actually left my previous gym to follow him here as we have been a team over 14 months now and he will always be  my trainer to keep me on track as he and I both know I need the accountability to stay on track. In a year I have lost 70 lbs with his help. He takes his job to heart and truly wants to see his clients reach their goals. If something isn't working, he will change the plan to fit you so the goals can be reached.  The equipment that they have has allowed Aaron to be able to push me to my limits by targeting certain muscles to get the results that I desire and to allow me to reach my goals. I am so thankful that I have met Aaron and that he has become such an important part of my life. I will always be grateful to him as he has helped changed my life for the better forever and that is something I can never repay him for. If you want results and will be true to yourself then I recommend Aaron as you will get those results if the work is put in that needs to be done! Aaron can't change you but he can help guide you so you can change you to get to your goals!I'm so excited this gym has opened! Brand new and the equipment is great! Lots of different pricing levels starting at only $6 bi-weekly for the basics which is enough unless you're into serious training. Childcare offered on site during your workout. No-hassle refund and cancellation policies. Great rates on personal training compared to other gyms in town. Keep it up!Love this gym !! It's a great atmosphere and its building a great community Dr Cruz is a highly skilled professional, who not only offers excellent eye health support,  but has an excellent ""Newfoundland"" caring personality. He doesn't talk at you, but discusses each concern in a caring personable manner. You feel he really cares. Dr Cruz has taken excellent care of us for many years. You can take his counsel to the bank. Gene and Marilyn Antle. Excellent customer service, and excellent haircutWas not there This place is magical. I love to see food be treated the right way. Take what you will eat and that's all. No huge packs no waste, beautiful. Better yet its way cheaper to buy some items here. 👍Lots of gluten and dairy free products, always new products and very well laid out store. Love shopping there and excellent staff.Bulk Barn is a go-to shopping destination for me. I find all the unusual stuff I'm looking for, in bulk, which I can put into my own containers and pass on the plastic bags. I find the prices reasonable and the quantities purchased are completely up to you. I've never been disappointed shopping at Bulk Barn. And if you're looking for something uncommon to satisfy a particular diet, in all likelihood, you'll find it here. Some of the not-so-common things I purchase, for example, are Buckwheat Honey, Corn Flour, Arrowroot, Brown or White rice flour, xanthan and guar... plus a whole section of candies and treats if you feel like being a little on the dietary wild side. Check it out! (Yes, this is an unsolicited, objective review!) A great service  very happy with what I got done .   friendly  professional and great quality  
My no1 choice for any denture work 

Thank you Mr Crowell Bright, clean store with lots of selection.   I don't sew near as much as I used to so I can't comment on the prices.Really great staff and management. A pleasure to deal with!Great store. Friendly staff and well laid out. My son has been going here since he was 5 months old and he LOVES it. He has learned so much and the staff are excellent! Highly recommend!Way over priced for the quality of care. My daughter is sent home almost daily and I'm left to pay a baby sitter and the daycare bill.Both of my kids spent the entire duration at this daycare and I can't say enough great things about the staff and the facilities there. Amazing group of people working there. They prepared both of my children for school and they made a lot of great friends there. Great location and very flexible and caring atmosphere. The Tiger is always great fun for shopping. The selection of products is excellent, you can find things here that are unique to the store, and priced for great value. The clothes are stylish, and affordable; the produce mostly Canadian, which makes me happier to spend there; and there's a lovely range of gifts and goodies all year round.good prices  watch  out for the  veg  they can be outLove this Giant tiger.  Staff friendly and helpful. Staff is super helpful and knowledgeable. Great experienceThe Sally's Team is always Friendly & Helpful.The staff are so nice, and extremely helpful! I don’t usually write reviews but you guys rock, love my hair extensions ;) Not a bad place but they do not offer direct billing to your insurance company which is a minor inconvenience. But the receptionist as well as the doctors there I have had a very good experience with.",business

"Great Teachers! Completed my Auto Tech and Red SealI was taking a first aid course and stopped in the cafeteria for lunch. The food was very good, large portions and very reasonably priced. There are a variety of foods for all tastes and a more upscale restaurant on campus.Great culinary program. Helpful instructors, well organized and re vamped program. Fantastic resources and in class work. As close to real life training as you can get! Great spot for a 5 course meal at a reasonable cost for 2 ppl and the food is as amazing as the students and the experience 👍👍Absolutely amazing BBQ meal.  Great food and very good caring service.  We will be back again and again and again.We had a great night and great service Great place to find a dependable Realtor. Happy to help you buy or sell your home. Knowledgeable agents and staff.Top notch professionals who care about their clients. Not pushy, they take their time and work with you to find what you like.Century 21 Trident is more than just a real estate company! They are experts whom really care about their client!

"Paula and the other teachers are great.
My daughter loves going to daycare here.

They keep it very clean, which helped a lot with our daughter not getting sick as much anymore.",business
"Great tasting pizza! The sauce is well cooked and balanced in flavor. The crust is light and fluffy. The pepperoni was slightly spicy and tasted amazing. Would definitely recommend this pizza too any pizza lover.Great variety of food with plenty of options for vegetarian and vegans. Everything here is full of flavor and delicious. Can't recommend this restaurant enough. Prices are fair for such good food.The vegan margarita pizza and garlic fingers were incredible! The vegan cheese used was perfect, the taste wasn't overwhelming (as it can be), and they used the perfect amount. The staff were amazing, so friendly and very knowledgable about vegan foods and dipping sauces. We were super impressed with everything. Awesome place. Relaxing, everyone was so nice. The bar guy was awesome. Asked my name never forgot it once. Great specials for a great price. They had a great musician. All around great place. 10/10 if I could.Nice looking place.  The server was friendly and received my order pretty quickly.  I had gone with the 2 piece fish and chips and it wasn't the best.  The fish was fried too long and the batter was very crunchy, with burned spots in some places.  I would probably give this pub a second shot and try another dish before deciding to write it off.We went with friends from our apartment building for wings. It was a fun evening.  The beer and wings combo was very good value. They had a guy playing guitar. Very nice neighborhood pub. I am new to the area and needed to find a new hairdresser.
I LOVED my experience at Infusion and look forward to enjoying more of their services!
Victoria did an outstanding job on my hair today! She listened to what I wanted and provided just that! She gave a killer head massage and the atmosphere was both relaxing, entertaining and fun!
I had the best time getting to know my hair dresser and can't wait to go back!

Anyone looking for top quality service should most definitely consider Infusion Spa!Not the best atmosphere and the service is a hit and miss. The technician who did my nails couldn’t shape them the way I wanted (she could only do the round shape) and I ended up with very short nails because of constant filing and failing to shape my nails as asked. 
Also, don’t expect a hand exfoliation, massage or even simple buffing of your nails. What you get is quite basic! Not a great selection of nail polish colours but that depends on individual taste.
Friendly staff though and very good pedicures, if you’re lucky and got a good tech.The staff make you feel welcome as soon as you arrive. Katie listened to my hair woes and made suggestions all through the process. I am absolutely a happy customer. I love my hair and love the color. Thanks so much. Dr. Paula is amazing with all of her clients. Our kids adore her and completely trust her throughout their appointments. Her staff is welcoming, professional and considerate at all times - we couldn't ask for better care!Welcoming office with a warm staff.  Great follow up.  Professional environment with a competent team.  Equipment is up to date.  Very little wait time.  Would highly recommend.Today I went for a cleaning to Southgate Dentistry, and I have to say this was the BEST cleaning I have ever had. Melissa was extremely meticulous at doing her job, she went above and beyond to clean every single crease and corner of my teeth even with my wires in (from past braces). My teeth have never felt so clean before, she didn't overly talk, it was quiet and she focused on her job which is exactly what I want as a hygienist. I will be returning to Melissa for my routine cleanings, and I am actually excited to be back in 6 months, Thank you Southgate Dentistry for having great staff. Blue Wave Cleaning Services is a fantastic company. They provide cleaning and janitorial services to our office and they perform at such high standards that our guests are always remarking at how clean and new this aging building looks! The people performing the services have been nothing short of wonderful to us; they are available in a pinch and they are reliable when scheduled. Josh does a wonderful job of making sure those high standards are upheld and the team assigned to us - headed by the lovely and thorough Agnes - can't be beat!

Blue Wave is nothing short of excellent. We are so happy with our cleaning services!These guys do great work. The team that cleans our location is super friendly and do a thorough job. I’d highly recommend Blue Wave Office Cleaning Services to everyone.Very well organized great staff great job very happy The staff are amazing!! We were anxious about putting our daughter into daycare, but her teachers are fantastic. They are engaged, fun, and they really connect with the children. Her development has really blossomed after starting daycare here. 
The food is fantastic and we love the little snack bar as you leave each day. 
It’s great to be able to check in through the day on the webcam and get pictures sent to you from her teachers. We love the daily reports to keep updated on how the days are going. 
From the teachers to the director, this place is absolutely amazing and worth every single penny!Nice  I have massage therapy with Ashley. She is beyond amazing! I have had several therapists in the past and she is the only one I have stuck with exclusively. She is super knowledgeable, makes your feel safe, sevure and well looked after. As for her treatments I have had grear success in treatment of a few different conditions  and always feel confident Im in the best hands!  She is a treasure for a therapist and I am so grateful to have her as mine!I have been visiting Nova Physio on Southgate for the past twelve months.  My knees are shot from work, sports, life, and my physiotherapist, Sam, has worked wonders to restore my mobility, flexibility, and to ease the pain in both my knees.  I am stubborn, and she certainly has the knowledge and patience to deal with me.  I definitely recommend her for all your physio needs!    
  In addition to my physio plan, I see their RMT Ashley every month.  She is a magician of sorts.  I go there because my back, or ribs, or knees kill me, and she works her wonders. Not a fluff and puff style, but more planned out and targeted.  I just lay down, let her work her magic and feel a random bubble pop from behind my knee caps (fat packs) or my ribs release, one by one... you will feel good right after, and for a few weeks following her treatment.
  Definitely a stellar group they have in there!I have been seeing Ashley for over a year for massage therapy, and she has made such a positive difference in my posture and overall health!  Thanks to her, I have been able to live my most active lifestyle in years.  She is professional, friendly and kind.  Ashley takes the time to explain her therapy plan, and ensures I always feel comfortable. I enjoy our sessions  tremendously.  Thank you Ashley!",business

"Had an amazing time at the Harvest Party last weekend! We just moved here from Ontario and it's been tough meeting people. The event was really well done - free admission, free BBQ, door prizes, photobooth, super cheap cash bar, DJ with vinyls?! Amazing. Thanks so much to the team who put this on; you can tell a lot of work went into planning it. We really enjoyed it and hope there are other future events!There is one staff member who is completely rude and useless. It's a beautiful place hopefully you dont go when she is working the desk. It would be a 5 star but now is a generous 3.Rented twice now.  Great facility.  We will be back!",business

Not a fun year you could say.Close to EVERYTHING you need within 20 min WALK plus on major bus route and cheaper prices apts but killam rocks as its my family name so always support!

Very nice centre. You can eat here through the week at lunch. 20.00 a yr you can be a member. Meals are very reasonable. If not a member only a 1.00 more to eat here. They sometimes have bus tours. Prices for these are also very reasonable.I was there visiting my sister she lives there if they had more parking for visitors I would of gave it a 5 star.Good place to have for seniors.

"Amazing cute place . Great treat I love to stop by for the seasonal specials or even just a Red Bean Taiyaki(my favourite) always fresh and warm made to order Taiyaki. 
The sandwich ones are also amazing the cheese is so good!My Girlfriend and I love this place! A bright beautiful cafe with an awesome menu and great prices.

We keep coming back to work our way through the menu but my favourite is the ham and cheese savory with the amazing chili maple sauce.

All of the above plus lovely staff make this our new favorite date spot and everybody should know about them!Usually really good experiences, the Taiyaki are always tasty (I think that's what the fish are called) had the ham sandwich which was sort of messy as it's puffed pastery but decent. Otherwise a great place for lunch or coffee!!",business
"These guys are excellent. Always so nice and pleasant to not just the dogs but also the people. I love going here! Leah and her staff are the best in terms of customer service, friendliness and; particularly, the kindness and patience they exhibit to not only my dogs but to all the resident dogs when I visit her business.  It is always a pleasure to experience Leah's smiles with her warm and pleasing personality.The greatest of groomers!!!  Highly recommend. My wife and I stopped in after Google searching a breakfast spot near the airport. This is an amazing gem! The food was AMAZING! The service great the scones fabulous!
The staff are so friendly and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend.Great little spot in Fall River. Cozy and clean with a wonderful menu of locally sourced ingredients. Tried the chicken, apple and brie croissant, which was delicious, as was the leek potato soup. Tea was excellent and peach scone was okay. Service was pleasant. Loved that there was no plastic waste such as straws or individual milkers. Patio has plenty of shade with umbrellas and a nice view of the river. Entry is located on the left side of the building and up the stairs. Would recommend.Been waiting a long while for a chance to try this spot and it was just wonderful. Delicious brunch all farm fresh home cooked ingredients. Quick friendly service great atmosphere. Truly a place worth making the effort to find. Great people. Good classes. Very convinent location for anyone in fall river.",business
"There are so many options for everyone I have come in with, the wildcard pizza and salad options are both always great. They're also really good with helping with different options to accommodate all of my allergies! Has become a regular spot my family.What I love about this place is you don't need to be vegan or vegetarian to enjoy the food. Their menu has something for everyone! The portions are generous, prices are on par with other veg spots around, and they offer daily specials which are always delicious! My only complaint would be the interior of the restaurant is pretty stuffy in the summer time. Not sure if they have A/C or maybe it was broken the day we were there but it was so muggy we opted to sit outside (in the rain) to escape the heat. Food wise though, the place is incredible!The food was so good... I didn't think a salad could taste that amazing, but it did! 😍🥰",business

"Was delish first time in. Cant wait to go back. Fish n Chips home made tarter sauce and fried onions on the dog were perfect. Lots of room to sit.Not bad but slightly overated, fish was overcooked and too oily. Batter was too chewy. Scallops were good. Clams too.wow eat here,
It gets better every year last night we had a three piece fish n chips to share and what a mound of food, fresh fish and it was all good  we will return Nice camping. Private spots available. Warm clean showers. Generally provincial Park on  Nova Scotia are consistent. there are very nice spots right on the lake if you want to pay for them. Flush toilet in hot shower and dump station. I love the yellow phone option if you just walk in without a reservation. The lake is a pretty little Lake good for kayaking.Beautiful camping or picnic grounds.  The provincial park is clean and well kept. The camping sites are large and have   shade and surrounded by trees for privacy. Great place for the beach.We like the Provincial Park and campgrounds in Canada. Problem is you have to book them 24 hours in advance.  Since we never knew where we were going to be each night that was tough. Depended on how much photography we got involved with each day.  We lucked out with their last site even though it had no hookups. But the sites are all very nice, lovely and well-maintained.  Private and spacious. Bill and Linda Lane, Montpelier, Virginia The people are friendly. Everyone is made to feel welcome.Small facility but great people. Needs parking. Best chicken burgers I've had in 20 years.Great people to play music for. The Engineering Campus at Sexton needs to have the facilities that the Collaborative Health Educational Building in Carleton Campus has, such as great study rooms, a variety of  big white boards, comfortable and fancy chairs, and more space to accommodate more students as possible. The place in Sexton that is made fully for studying is the Sexton library which is trash. Other than that it has caring and helpful staff members that are willing to work for the understanding and benefit of studentsI have to take two courses again because I was doing another degree, and the staff at my new department thinks the material was different (which the other people has already used these courses in the past). Very upset about how the stuff of the dal are unhelpful, and make me to do the same courses that I already passed. After 5 yrs with dal I actually slightly regretted of coming here.Very good and walking around location in Halifax city many local events are available always... We finally got out to our first Mooseheads game, and had a great time! The seats are very comfortable, although a bit tight. Some of the signage was a bit confusing but the layout was great - not a bad seat in the place. They have a great variety of snacks and drinks, but could maybe have more candy options for the kiddos (like bagged candy etc). We look forward to going back!Tonight was my first time there since the renovations a while back.  Saw Harry Potter in Concert with my family.  The place looks great and the show was fantastic. However,  while the seats have lots of cushion, if you're over 5'3"" they're terribly uncomfortable and cramped.  I'm 5'11"" on a good day and for the life of me I couldn't get comfortable, to the point in which I thought I was going to have to leave early.  Also, as others have noted, concession prices are unreasonably high.Great place to go for entertainment.  This time we caught a Moosehead game. Next visit will be to catch a traveling Broadway show. There is always some thing fun going on here to bring the family to. The Immigration Experience tour was fantastic. As the tour guide, who immigrated in 2017, explained what my parents went through in 1952 I could tell she herself identified with the whole experience.
I am glad that Canada opened their borders to the world, making our country even better by the diversity we now see.F A N T A S T I C ! Every Canadian  should visit this museum when in Halifax. I loved it. Nice displays. Small area where the staff can help you find ancestors who arrived here! They found a picture of the boat that sailed from England and arrived with my grandfather in Canada in 1928. Amazing. They also gave me other information that I never knew. Great! 🙂Makes you think about our place here. Almost all of us are immigrants and sometimes I feel we forget that. Lots of cool displays and interactions. Beautiful firsthand experiences and stories of past and contemporary migrants. It's located center of dal where fancy and convenientEveryone is very helpful and nice in the office, especially Jocelyn BUT I marked them down because she hurt my feelings today

PS. If she apologizes and admits she did wrong MAYBE I'll bump it upGreat date night!",residential

"The worst experience in my life and thank god not for my 4,5 years old son because he is young and he won’t remember anything (hopefully). For them the kids are money and that’s it . If your kid is not an angel and apparently not from Canada I guess.... they will kick him/her from the daycare ,and the reason????? I will tell you . Not enough resources. Summer camp means 2 teachers with 25-30 kids . So the one teacher can not  give time to your kid because the other teacher has to take care of the rest 24-29!!!!! So get out of my daycare . That’s what Daydreams’s day care is . Shame on you ☹️Both of our children attended DayDreams. Both children had an excellent experience at this child care center.",business
"my boyfriend and I have been living here for a bit now and are super content. spacious room, lovely view, the tenants are super helpful and welcoming, more than enough laundry units, 2 elevators, and upkept maintenance. the walls are super thick as well, so noise isn't an issue one bit.If you are a clean, friendly and respectful person then this is the place for you! Me and my wife can't say enough good things about Southpoint.  We lived there for 4 years total.  The management changed during this time, but we were extremely happy with the new building Managers Deo and Natasha.  Every time there was a problem, we sent them a message, and it would usually get addressed within a day.  Very friendly, caring, and easy to talk to.  There were some issues with the building such as, some dryers not working, old elevators, but there is no perfect place.  We were on the 8th floor and never saw any mice, or bugs.    Overall we were very happy with the old management, as well as the new one.  We would come back and live here!Staff is nice, the place is clear in general. The building is from the 70's and some apartments have outdated kitchen cabinets, but the stove and fridge are good. The garbage/trash area could be better organized and clean, and the laundry machines could be card operated. Apart from that, it's a good place, specially because of the location.

"They are awesome at cutting key at less then what walmart charge too only payed $1 something for to cut a key here where at walmart it cost $3.99+ taxI get keys cut at Beeler because they always work, unlike keys cut by Canadian Tire. Plus Beeler is faster and half the price.Beeler installed new front and rear deadbolts and knobs for us two years ago - a minor service was required just recently and they were kind enough to stand behind their product and waived the service fee.

"Amazing school, all the instructors that I've had or heard of are great, wonderful and super modern facilities, janitorial staff are always on top of things so the building stays clean all the time. The building is split into 2 very distinct sections, and the harbor section has an atrium with a flag representing every student and faculty that have gone through the schoolVery modern campus! I had a 2 days program for ECE which was very helpful and beneficial. I didn’t check on the main majors of the university so im not quite sure about its programs. Here are some of the posters that I found interesting. 
Very clean and well organized! Classes were quite big.I go here it's actually great very poor communication Very new buisness, still working out the kinks but seems to be getting betterConsistently out of menu items. Usually at lunch rush. You are typically not informed until after ordering (and paying). 

These items include but are not limited to:
-Wraps
-Bread for sandwiches
-Lettuce
-Sauces like chipotle and ranch
-Tomatoes
-Wedges

This location has been consistently awful since opening.Understaffed, ",business
"The Engineering Campus at Sexton needs to have the facilities that the Collaborative Health Educational Building in Carleton Campus has, such as great study rooms, a variety of  big white boards, comfortable and fancy chairs, and more space to accommodate more students as possible. The place in Sexton that is made fully for studying is the Sexton library which is trash. Other than that it has caring and helpful staff members that are willing to work for the understanding and benefit of studentsI have to take two courses again because I was doing another degree, and the staff at my new department thinks the material was different (which the other people has already used these courses in the past). Very upset about how the stuff of the dal are unhelpful, and make me to do the same courses that I already passed. After 5 yrs with dal I actually slightly regretted of coming here.Very good and walking around location in Halifax city many local events are available always... Prospective international student, skeptical because I experienced a rude staff. Institutions should definitely put warm people at 'customer' interaction positions. The staff at Richard Ivey's was more professional and helpful.Wonderful environment.Nice building, relatively new. One of the best business programs in Canada.  The only thing I did not like was being two floors Below the world so you had no idea what was going on outside. Oh and they were doing some kind construction during the day that interrupted our speaker. Could the center maybe consider doing repairs/construction at a non event time?Always an event happening here. The food is always amazing.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.  And the setup always looks great.Great location. I was there for a IBTTA annual meeting and it was very nice. A lot of bars around the convention centre to do networking after business. I can’t even put into words how incredible the staff is. I was airlifted there from PEI and the paramedic with me would check on me every few minutes to make sure I was feeling ok. I had many tests and scans done and they went really well. for the long ones they would even put a movie on for me to watch so I wouldn’t be bored. I had a couple abdominal surgeries as well, my surgeon and his team were outstanding they literally saved my life. The nurses on 7 link were amazing they were always very loving. I also spent some time on 6 link and although they were some of the worst days of my life the staff always found ways to make me happy. I cannot express how amazing this hospital is and how grateful I am for what they have done for me. If I could rate more than 5 stars I would.IWK was an amzing hospital. They helped my son so much and provided him help with so much love and spirit. Always very up beat and happy. My son has had a quite a few stays there, and never had a bad experience.

"I volunteered here and I had a blast!
:DBest place we could have sent our kids prior to school. The school is amazing, the teachers are loving and caring and really good at tailoring curriculum to each and every individual child's needs and strengths. When our son was really into dinosaurs, they did a dinosaur unit. When our daughter was needing individual attention and extra support because she was ill, the teachers spent one-on-one time with her doing activities with manipulatives and sensory activities that calmed her. 
The school also feels like a real community - there is a bi-annual backyard party in the beautiful, treed backyard playground, a weekly e-mail goes out with pictures of all the kids, and there is an annual beer and art show which is fun for the parents. We can't speak highly enough of this school and would certainly encourage any family looking for a half day preschool (rather than daycare) program to enroll their kids.Our daughter loved going to school every day. The teachers made every kid feel encouraged and cared for. We look forward to when our son is old enough to go!",business

"More knowledgeable salesman than anywhere I've been for flooring. Lots of selection and not bad prices. The salesman really was top-notch. So impressed!Poor experience dealing with Reg and Wacky’s. The job started off great, but it was clear that once the bulk of it was finished we were a low priority, leaving all sorts of t’s to be crossed and i’s to be dotted on our own. After the flooring and baseboard job went longer than the forecasted one week, we were dragged along with “coming by tomorrow to finish it up” for 2+ weeks, we had to escalate and move on to another labourer. Joe, thankfully saved the day and finished the job for us, over the course of 2 visits over the next 2 months (his quality control services seem to have him consistently booked 1+ months out... which should probably be of concern that he needs to be called on so often)...Unfortunately the original labourer used the wrong baseboards in one room (which were shorter) and cut them to fit in the wrong room, meaning the drywall damage from demo in our other room (where there had originally been taller baseboards) was no longer able to be covered - a cost and effort we took on repairing with a handyman down the street to push the job along, as Wacky’s again was dragging their feet. 

Happy with Joe’s finishing the job. Very disappointed with Reg’s inability to manage the workforce, and hold his team accountable to communicated quality standards. We had a handyman down the street finish the job for us, by polishing it up to sale-ready standards. The Floors were done okay - Consensus amongst our friends seems to be that the quality of the install is average. Would recommend tempering your expectations if you go With wacky’s - these guys are no better than the average floorer off Kijiji, they just come with middle man charges and theoretical accountability.Jay was amazingly helpful!! Carolyn was excellent to deal with and helped us find the mattress that was right for us. The delivery time was setup when we purchased and arrived on-time. The two men who delivered the mattress worked really hard at fitting the mattress up the stairs, but didn't give up and got into the room!  Overall a great experience.We had a great experience with Carolyn on two separate visits to Worldwide Furniture. Carolyn was helpful,  attentive and knowledgeable, able to answer all of our questions and concerns.   I highly recommend Worldwide Furniture in general and specifically Carolyn after our two excellent visits.Had a bad experience today while attempting to go into worldwide, arrived ten minutes before the store closed to browse quickly knowing they closed soon. The gentlemen said they were closed and only looking after customers already in the store and would not allow us in. Terrible customer service, if you close at 6 stay open until the posted time. The guy was very rude about it as well. Great shopping experience! Stephen Millar was exceptional in customer service. He was not pushy and was able to put you at ease very easily. He had a lot of patience with us and we truly appreciated his calm, pleasant demeanour.
I would definitely shop here again!we've been into the store 2x in the past 2 weeks working with Stephen Miller (salesman) on purchasing the right sectional sofa for our space. He is very knowledgeable, listened to what we wanted, honest and not pushy at all! We are going back to make the purchase with him shortly and would recommend him to anyone.Paid couple of thousand dollars for new bedroom in July and received all pieces finally in November. Priceless! Zero help from STEVE MILLER Senior Sales Associate. One star is a lot but I’m generous today even disappointing from my bad experience with Ashley. 
Please think before paying and ask for reasonable delivery date. Decent for newcomers and low income group  Great designers. Mayby I am a little bias 😊 lolStaff was great and service:)Love my AyA kitchen!",business
"My child has been attending DVRCCC for a few months now and is definitely thriving. He had never been cared for by anybody outside of family so I was worried about how both he and I would cope. Rose answered all of my questions, explained the process of getting him started, and is always readily available if we need anything. She made the transition into daycare quick, easy and painless!

The employees are very attentive and caring, and I get a comprehensive daily rundown of activities, restroom visits, attitude/behavior, and everything eaten. I never thought my child could nap on a mat on the floor, but he’s never had a problem there! The food and snacks provided are great, and the menu is posted weekly. They get plenty of time outside in a private play space, and they encourage independence (self dressing, serving themselves food) which I greatly appreciate. Friday’s are extra special because they attend yoga and music classes.

The door is always kept locked and a staff member will do a visual check before letting you in. They have a paper system of checking in and out where you can advise if somebody other than yourself is handling pickup that day. You also fill out a form where you advise them if anybody other than yourself is allowed to do a pickup. I’ve introduced my in-laws so they know the process and the caregivers recognize them, and each time they gently remind us that ID and double checking will be required, and when in doubt they will call a parent to confirm. I don’t have any concerns about my child’s security while at DVRCCC. 

My child spends a lot of his time with Josie, Courtney and Ashley and they are very caring, patient, understanding and fun! When we have a rough drop off, my son gets the individual attention he needs so I can leave and know he’s in good hands. I would highly recommend DVRCCC to anybody looking for a quality daycare provider in HRM. Thanks, Ladies!Never! Never! NEVER!!!! Place your child in their care! They have on several occasions allowed my daughter be removed from their care facility by people who are NOT ALLOWED to pick her up! They would knowingly allow someone who is not her family OR guardian and had written documentation expressing that this man was not to pick her up. The staff was indifferent to the whole situation. Completely unprofessional. ",business

"My son and I have mad a nice little home for ourselves at King Andrew Tower. We’ve been in our place now since May 2016 and love it! Wonderful and very friendly supers, beautiful apartment and gorgeous view of Halifax! The supers organize things like a Christmas social, little yard sales in the community room which are nice added touches when apartment living! Supers keep the building very clean and presentable!!! The gym and store are also nice added touches!King Andrew Towers is a great location for easy access in and out of the city. Lots of parking is available— even an area for guest parking. My one bedroom apartment is spacious and has had many upgrades over the last few years. Rick and Johann are excellent supers. They respond quickly to any concerns. The building is well kept.We've lived in the King Andrew Tower for four years and really love our 2 bedroom apartment. We always get compliments when we have new visitors and everyone always thinks our spare bedroom is our main one and then are blown away at the sheer size of our master bedroom. 
Ricky and Johann are awesome supers and always willing to help when  we call them. 

Only complaint would be that the wooden stairs behind the building leading up to the intersection have been busted for a couple of years now, though I'm not even sure who would be in charge of the repairs considering a number of businesses also have offices in the building. My kids love it here so much! The teachers and staff have been incredible accommodating and caring for my two autistic preschoolers. My daughter says every day first thing in the morning “come on let’s go to school!” When it’s not a preschool day for them she stands at the door crying to go to school! When I drop them off the are so happy they don’t even bother to say good bye to me they just run in as fast as they can to play with teachers and friends. When I pick them up they try to run away from me and don’t want to go home. My son will be saying “good bye friends, good bye teachers, I love you” as we are leaving. The staff are always so excited to share my children’s accomplishments with me every day. I feel 100% safe and happy leaving my kids in the care of Care n Fun child care centre. We couldn’t be happier with their behaviour development since starting there.My son loves going there.He’s always happy to go, and always enjoys the activities they have planned for the day. Personally I love the meals that they are giving the kids, super healthy and filling, my son never comes home hungry. They are  super nice to deal with and have a lot of patience for kids (especially for my son who has mild cerebral palsy). All in all 10/10 would recommend !Care & Fun people are so amazed. They have professional staffs, and good food services, as well as wonderful environment for learning and developing children. Highly I recommend it.",business

My daughter is so happy there.

Even their capacity is limited because they are located inside the building, but all rooms are well managed and they have a balcony which is used as a play ground for fresh air and they have sandy playground by the water as well.

The only problem is parking lot, because you either should park on the fire lane temporary on your own which most of us do, or park inside the building which you should pay an amount each time.

I would like to recognize some staffs but all I see is they are all professionals.",business

"Great local produce, always great vendors willing to sample there wares.
The apple is cider is not to be left behind.
Grab a sausage and world famous pepperoni from Sweet Williams.
Fresh Eggs.
Local Honey at half the price at a local grocery. This list could go on and on.
Oh and not to mention great local artists showing off there stuff!I've been at this market a few times! There is such a big variety of delicious ready-to-eat hot and cold foods from many different cultures. Great for going alone or with your family or large group :) Most of the vendors accepted card but cash is a much quicker transaction. There is an ATM in the building and bathrooms. I had delicious steam buns and a mango banana smoothie :) Across the street is a brewery if you are looking for more adventure :)Interesting, fun place to visit.  The food is good but there are not that many places to sit and eat.  It's right next to the cruise ship terminal so it can be very busy at times. The 2 servers working behind the counter were both really accommodating and welcoming! The prices are very reasonable and they offer cooking classes too.

I would take off a Star here, as the flavors are not very Indian / spicy / authentic. It is made fresh to order and some stuff might be better than others.Best Indian I have had in a very long time.  Had the lamb curry.  The sauce tastes like fireworks in the mouth-a high concentration of spice, not just starch or fillers which is what I am used to having.  Very high quality.  I highly recommend it.I was lured into this place by the smell of delicious spices, and I was not let down. BEST CHANNA MASALA I HAVE EVER HAD! Spicy with such an amazing depth of flavor. I might even say it’s even the best Indian food I have ever had. If I didn’t live on the other side of the continent I would probably eat here at least once a week! Exceptional food that you must try!   The fillet of the fish and chips is fresh and breaded differently then elsewhere.  Avocado sandwich is good.  There is a little area to entertain the infants dispute if the size of the store.  In case you can’t find a seat, just get take out and head upstairs.So good! After a rainy walk from the ferry and being disappointed by the market this was just the thing to save the day! The food was so fresh and delicious, the latte was good and the orange carrot juice super fresh! The staff was friendly and gave us some good advice about when to visit the market to get peak vendors. The restaurant was clean, and there was a cute little area for my son to play. I would definitely come back the next time we are at the market.Best fresh eggs and thick bacon and crispy toast... IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. Coffee's good too. My favourite butcher shop in Halifax. Hands down. Full service butcher with cuts not many others carry.

Couple that with vertical integration of their supply (they raise their own animals on their own feed, and you get a quality of meat and a selection that's unparalleled in town!Great meat selection and love the options.  Service is terribly slow, probably about half the speed of the other meat shops in the market and not because there are more customers waiting.  The people behind the counter seem to keep themselves busy but nobody bothers to look up to see if you want service.  I’ve had people who arrived several minutes later get service first.  They need a quicker more organized approachOne of the best places to get meat in Halifax, if I have the time I will always get meat from here over anywhere else. All of the staff are super friendly and service is quick and easy. 
The meat itself is fantastic, everything I've tried has been great. I appreciate the local produce and supporting local businesses. No clue what we even ordered but there was a pastry with gingerbread, blueberry, and some sort of whipped icing (?).. IT WAS SO GOOD!!! And so was my pastry with almonds!!

The left is the gingerbread one, the right is my almond one. Both very delicious and rich. We also went on a day that they were 25% off which was a bonus! 

We ate on the rooftop patio that the woman working was so kind to tell us about, as we had no idea it even existed!I was in Halifax for one day, and got some chocolates from this shop. They were all so good! If you’re in the area, I highly recommend giving them a try!Best Macroons you will ever have!
They also made my wedding cake which everyone asked who baked it.
It didn’t just look amazing it tasted incredibly yummy.

"Edward Jost Children's Centre is an absolutely phenomenal facility. Roughly 10% of the children in their care are children with special needs who require specific care, and they are amazing at providing for these children; they truly care about them from the heart. The ways they teach the children to handle everyday issues are also excellent; the children they teach have little to no behavioural issues (save for those whose behavioural issues stem from a preexisting condition). They strongly encourage the children to take on their own social conflicts with kind and calm words, rather than always having a teacher intervene. The results are, quite simply, beautiful. There isn't enough one can say to properly praise this facility; they are truly remarkable, and have done wonders for the children in their care. From the director to the kitchen staff, every employee in the facility cares deeply about the children who attend this daycare; it's much more than just a job to them, and it shows.
I stumbled across Edward Jost Children's Centre completely by chance, and there couldn't have been a happier accident for myself and my five-year-old child, who has high-functioning autism. In September, he was barely able to communicate with others, despite his speech itself being quite clear. It is now April, and, aside from behavioural outbursts, most people would never know he has autism at all. He has of course had help through prescribed therapy, but without the support and encouragement he receives at EJCC, as well as being able to play so amicably with other children and learn from them, he would never have come so far so fast. Thanks to the combined efforts of EJCC and his therapists, he will be able to attend school in the fall. In September of last year, that was not an option at all, nor did it seem like it would be anytime soon. They are beyond accommodating when it comes to his needs; they're more than willing to adapt their teaching styles to fit what works best for him and helps him to make progress.
I really can't say enough to express how much I appreciate Edward Jost Children's Centre. I very highly, with utmost enthusiasm, recommend it.",business

"The school is horrible. This school is not religious at all. It spreads the wrong message and is a very horrible school. I’ve attended that school for 11 years and have never seen any goods of the school at all. Most of my classmates and good friends have never in their lives said that it was a good school. The teachers that are hired have no degrees and if they did, they have degrees in wrong fields (my grade 11 math teacher just graduated university with a bachelors and has no experience in teaching). Some teachers (rarely) are very good and treat students with respect but some teachers are very cruel ( their was many complaints of a teacher hitting and pushing students and was never Suspended or fired). The structure of the school is terrifying. The ceilings and pipes were leaking when I was attending and felt like it was going to collapse. The outside and inside of the school is identical to a prison. The parking lot was recently fixed but for the 11 years I’ve attended the school, their was potholes in every direction, it was scary to park there.

Edit: As you said that the school has added after school activities, in my 11 years attending there, their was nothing really to do except learn. We had no after school activities but a basketball team that we had to pay a lot of money for. After the new administration came (which is mostly Egyptian), half the population of the school decided to go somewhere else and are left with no one. They also decided to sue the old principle so they won’t lose money.  Those improvements you are talking about are not even improvements, they are small unneeded changes.What a place i pray for this great muslim realitionship eachotherGreat effort  in short time",business

"The staff is friendly and helpful but beware of their quotes for services. I have been using this veterinary clinic for over 10 years and not once have they quoted me proper prices for medical services rendered for my pets. They have always been on the pricey side for services and purchases. With that said, they do give a 10% discount on products and medicines for return customers.
Still a great place and I feel my pets are safe while in their care.Wonderful care for your family pets. The staff are wonderful, always friendly and helpful. I've always been very happy with the care my pets recieved and the vets and techs clearly love the animals. If your looking for a caring reliable vet I would always recommend Carnegy.We took our four-month old kitten to this vet clinic. He had been very sick for two days throwing up and not eating. The first visit cost over $400 which included an x-ray. The next day, they did a more comprehensive x-ray with barium and still didn't know what was blocking his system. That visit was over $500. They said they needed to do surgery which would be in the range of $2,000 to $3,000. We took him to a vet in Truro who did another x-ray and found the obstruction had moved and waited patiently. A few hours later the blockage cleared on its own WITHOUT SURGERY. With Carnegy clinic looking after the kitten he would have suffered major surgery and long recovery time. We will never go there again.  They are very professional and it’s a very nice environment for kids.The kids loved it! :D

I had a veggie samosa with mango chutney and a side of pasta salad with broccoli, cheese and bacon. Deeeelicious. They also have Laughing Whale coffee (organic and one of my favorites) as well as Goodmore Kombucha (also my favorite). There is water / glasses available so help yourself to that. I will definitely be a regular here!! Welcome to the community!!!",business

"We sent our 18 month old here for one month before having to switch due to commute reasons.

This is a fantastic school with truly caring staff. The facilities are not brand new, well-used is the word I'd use, but their in-house gym and playground facilities are probably a rarity compared to other peninsula day cares.

After the first week our little girl would stroll into her class, wave goodbye to me, plonk herself next to the other children (all quietly seated around the table), and patiently waited for her snack. Magic. In contrast her new daycare seems far more chaotic. 

The toddler room is well sized and equipped. Food prepared seemed above average. Updates were plentiful. Admin staff were prompt. Well secured environment (asked me for ID during first pick up).",business

"I am very impressed with the customer service. I spent 4 hours trying to find the best phone plan with an apple employee who also called their Rogers representative to make sure i was getting the best deal. Very patient and took the time to ensure myself and my mom fully understood everything down to making a spread sheet to compare the different prices! 
 Very honest and upfront. I felt no pressure in making a decision. Very knowledgeable about their products and phone plans. 
Great atmosphere and everyone is more than willing to help you find what you need and to educate you on any product. Very impressed!Very upset about my experience at the apple store. I cabbed there to pick up my iPhone 11pro, purchased it with a case that was for the iPhone 11pro and I asked one of the workers if a screen protector i was showing him was glass and also if it was for the 11 pro because for some reason there is absolutely no indication on the box of which phone the screen protectors are made for which is ridiculous. 

The guy working told me it was both for the 11pro and glass but when I got home it did not fit my phone as it was for the iPhone 11 and it was also plastic. Incompetent of the staff to not know their own products. I had to cab back and get a new one and did not even receive a refund for their staff being uneducated about their own products.The manager of Apple store said the quality of apple product is not good and I was lucky that my experience was good about apple product. Look like the seller do not love their product and they put the profit in the priority, instead of customer satisfaction.",residential

I'd definitely recommend her to anyone.I went to see David and he is amazing! I can't get over how great he was.

The staff at Massage experts are very friendly and professional and I would recommend them to anybody I know who needs/is looking for a massage.Massage Experts is very expensive compared to other places even with health insurance. 
The environment at Massage Experts is set up for massages, nicely decorated  and looks clean. The massage therapists however that I saw were NOT good at giving massages. I won't be going back anymore. A few days ago, I ordered an arrangement of roses from Flower Trends, for my moms birthday. She absolutely loves them! Flower Trends is my go-to flower store, for every occasion. They have the best quality flowers, of course, but what I like the most about them is they are experts at customer service and delivering value. They will go the extra mile for you, every time. Thank you Flower Trends Florists.Roxanna designed the most beautiful flower arch, bouquets and boutonnieres for our wedding this August! She was amazing to work with and really listened to what we were looking for. Thank-you so much! We loved the flowers on our wedding day.Flowers were apparently lovely and delivery very prompt. Will order again from this florist. Excellent store for the young budding reader. With sections clearly labeled to help you find the age appropriate novels for your children. Great selection of books, novels, toys and plush toys to stimulate the imagination of the children.Great selection of books, service was great.  The sales person was helpful and mentioned that they could order certain selections in if they didn't have them in store.  The toy selections was not as extensive as the books, but there were different items that I didn't see in other stores.Great service and a wide selection of items
 Books, toys, and lego to name a few. Certainly store for any adult interested in finding items to help enlighten children. When I first walked in I didn't expect much considering the past few times I got my nails done at different places they butchered them and were over priced garbage. These guys at T.A Nails know exactly what they are doing!! My nails are so shiny and smooth! The guy who did them for me was very nice as well!! I only paid 60 bucks and it was well worth it in my opinion. I WILL be going back!i would rate this place a five after going a few hours ago! The service was great and he was always asking how i was doing and telling me what he was about to proceed with. The place was VERY CLEAN and you know that because right after getting them done and dried they brush off the access and ask you to go wash your hands. (It took around 45 minutes for them to be complete) He was not one of those people who talked to the other worker the whole time or one  of those people who didnt talk at all, he started conversations when necessary and told me advice on maintaining the nails. Most of all I LOVE THEM!This place is amazing for getting nails done.the people will treat you like family, and the employees are super nice!! I found the great deal they advertised and purchased it. It was amazing.Perfect day to take the bus over! Wherever I went, I received good help in the stores. The heat outside also helped. :)The Woodlawn plaza is a good place they have the Giant tiger / Staples the bargain barn and lots of other shops there I go there a couple times a month to shop for things.",business

"I needed tires mounted and a front end alignment.  Tires got mounted but the alignment couldn’t be done because of my vehicle’s stability control system. $20 taxes in to get a tire mounted and balanced is a great value.  Plus I dropped my truck off and their shuttle got me to work and back.
What stuck out in my mind was how clean the customer area was.  A lot of shops overlook the state of the area where the customer spends their time.
I will definitely return and recommend to others.Get my winter tire changed within an hour, very happy about their service.The staff are phenomenal and the prices are super reasonable. Ask for Mike... he'll treat you  right",business

"The staff here are usually really friendly. I always come here to deposit my pay cheque, sometimes I'll be waiting for 15 minutes with only one person ahead of me. I feel as if this place needs to work on their time management a little bit. Not always bad, depends who you get that day. Have had nothing but good things to say about all the staff .When I went to deposit a cheque, the guy asked me 100 questions about my life and why I had this cheque. This seemed totally inappropriate and far beyond anything I've encountered at a bank before. He told me there is absolutely nothing he can do for me and I have to wait for a 5 day hold, he was very rude about how he said this. I slept on it and the next day, accepting my defeat, I went back to deposit it anyway. A girl this time says to me she'll see what she can do for me, and manages to get me a few thousand released right there. So what on earth was the other guys problem?  I guess it's hit or miss whether you run into a jerk on a powertrip or an employee who wants to help out. I didn't know this place was tucked in the plaza but now that I do, I'll be back frequently! Great decor (Love the guide on the wall!), very friendly service and the most important part - perfectly fresh, sushi! The serving sizes are very generous for the price. Definitely a great find!The sushis were delicious. Great value for great food. Can't wait to come back some evening to try one of their noodle dishes and tempura.
The paintings on the walls are unique 😆I never ever write reviews, but I had to for this restaurant. I love this place!! The staff are sooooo friendly and the food is amazing!! It's my favorite sushi place now!! Also the murals on the walls always make me smile :) New owners are very nice. Food is good and service was fast and friendly.  The owner took a lot of time to talk to us .Great authentic food and good service. Much improved since our last visit.I've been to this location twice for dim sum on the weekends. The first time the food was average at best, nothing to write home about. The second time I was appalled by their service. When my husband and I left without leaving our normal tip percentage, the cashier/waitress called us out in front of the entire restaurant and asked why we didnt tip more. We are normally 15-20% tippers and more if the service was amazing. I dont believe that tipping in Canada is mandatory. I also dont think its polite to yell at your customers and question why they dont tip you after poor service. Needless to say, we wont be returning. I gave this restaurant 2 stars because the food was alright. Not worth the 20 min drive from Halifax.

Addendum

You are absolutely right. I'm wrote this review on the wrong restaurant. Thanks for politely pointing this out. Sorry about the confusion. Best record store in HRM. Fantastic selection with new arrivals on a near daily basis. Mike and Dave, the co-owners, are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. I cannot count the number of albums I've been unable to find anywhere else, including online, that I've found great copies of here. If you are in the area and haven't gone to Select, you are missing out!I can always count on coming here and finding good classics and wicked rarities. A very special storeA wonderful collection of music alphabetically and/or categorically organized. You'd be hard pressed to not find what what you went in searching for and maybe something completely new. PLEASE READ: I recently had an IPL Photofacial done at Enlighten Bedford with scary results. The appointment started with a free consult where I was asked various question about skin type, exposure and area of concern, I was asked repeatedly if I had sun exposure to which my answer was “Tuesday” (2 days prior) I did not have a burn nor did I have a tan. We went on to start the treatment, the tech continued to pause and examine my skin - so much so that I started to feel uncomfortable and said “you are starting to make me feel uncomfortable, are you unsure about treating me?” She said “no, you should be fine” and she started the machine. It was very painful and made me jump on the bed. I asked if this was normal and she giggled and said “yes, you’re doing better than most.” I left the treatment feeling extremely sunburned but was assured this is normal. By the time I got home was in tears and couldn’t take ice away from my face. I knew something wasn’t right so seeked a second opinion for another laser company who told me I was 100% burned by the machine being turned up too high. I then went to the doctor and was told the same - that I had 1st degree burns. I called the clinic to let them know expecting more than just “tips to care for a burn” the tech who did the procedure admitted to it being a burn once I sent her my pics but when I contacted the company owner she told me that I had received a “great treatment.” And said that I would be pleased with the results in 7-10 days. This was no comfort to me since all the research I did said nothing of your skin being burnt in the process. All I asked for from the owner was my money back and to pay for the burn prescriptions 
($ 49.00 & $ 37.00)and I heard no response, I am not in this to bad mouth anyone which is why I am leaving names out but perhaps that tech needs extra training. It is my hope that this review can prevent this from happening to someone else. An IPL facial should never leave you walking away with first degree burns .. ever.I have had laser hair removal and have great success.I have had 7 sessions and I feel the next should be my last . Jackie always made me  feel comfortable during my sessions. Very professional. I have had the teeth whitening also, with some sucess. I had hoped to see better results but at least there was some improvement. 
I recommend Enlighten Laser Bedford location ,  Vickie at reception is very friendly and if she doesn’t have an answer to your question she will get back to you. 
LindaThe hair removal treatments did not work for me, and there is no flexibility to re-purpose unused sessions for another treatment and no refund.  Customer satisfaction is constrained by Enlighten's corporate rules.

I understand that I signed the waiver and fine print that nobody reads, but I still don't expect businesses to hide behind this to avoid making a customer happy when something doesn't work. I have gone to Bedford Orthotics for many years and have had excellent service from Andrea Richard and her team. I would highly recommend them!Andrea and staff are very knowledgeable. Andrea takes the time to provide the services you require while also educating on the use of orthotics, proper shoe selection and foot care. She is kind, intelligent and always very willing to go the extra mile. Receiving excellent customer service is quite uncommon today, but you can expect that when you are with Andrea and Bedford Orthotics. Thanks for helping me be Pain Free today.Me and my flat arches have been coming to Bedford Orthotics for many years now.  Andrea and the team take great care of you and make a quality product that just makes your mobile life far more comfortable.  Supported my feet in many adventures, and trust Andrea to get it right, with a really quick turn around, as always. Great service and reasonable pricesBoyfriend had his hair cut and it was wavy and bumpy on top. Low quality cut done. Had to get someone else to fix it.Until today I was a regular customer... always went back to the same stylist (Julie) and got pretty good service... I normally tip about 30%+ but that didn't seem to matter. Today I called and actually spoke to Julie... said she was working until 5 PM... I showed at 4:25 and was told I just missed her. This is the second... and last time I go out of my way and get stood up.

I was going to First Choice because it was hard for me to schedule my next apportionment while getting my hair cut. I guess it's just as hard to be told your stylist will be working until a specified hour and then be let down again.  

Fool me once... shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me; fool me for the third time... my fault... no need to waste my time here any more. 

They're no cheaper if you're trying to just walk in and be served... choose a shop that will at least stay there until you arrive. My time and effort should be worth something. 

Not happy at all... might as well go to the Head Shoppe. Jeff was so amazing and professional with handling my case, I can not express how grateful I am for how easy he made the whole process for me and fighting for me. I would definitely recommend him if you’re looking for someone friendly, professional and in it for you. I can not say enough great things about Nova Injury Law! 😊The people and personal service at Nova Injury Law are what sets the firm apart. Both Jeff and Darren’s knowledge and expertise in a wide range of personal injury and disability law ensures that your claim is in confident and capable hands. Trish, the firm’s paralegal, ensures that each clients’ claim progresses at an efficient pace and has consistently been praised as the most courteous and proficient legal professional that clients have ever dealt with. 

Overall the team at NOVA Injury Law stands out as knowledgeable, efficient, and personal. You can rest assured that Nova Injury Law is a great firm for your case and will always have your best interest at heart!Jeff Mitchell is knowledgeable, responsive and most importantly effective. I cannot think of anyone I would rather have representing me in my motor vehicle claim.  What's good about this place is you are always paired with a dietitian. Their dietitians are very friendly and understanding. Also very good at adapting their General eating plan to each individual. It is costly but still less than what you would pay for a private dietitian. They sell some snack foods and meals that can be a help when you're tired of trying to figure out what to cook. I lost weight on this but cannot afford to keep going so I have switched to another diet organization. Derrick is a great to work with.  He meets people on their own level.  Very approachable and easy to talk to.  Over the years knowing Derrick he always has a positive spin and can make you look at different views to improve your approach on a given situation or concern. Before appointment I had an assessment with the nurse to fill a form for general health information, to mention my concerns, and my budget. I complained about the circles and wrinkles under my eyes, and an horizontal line between my eyebrows. I mentioned I had fillers done in the past in another clinic, and I have had great results. I also made sure that she knew about my maximum budget. That was my first time ever doing a esthetic treatment in Canada, and she knew that. 

After the assessment with the nurse, I assumed all the information was passed to the doctor, but I wanted to reinforce the results I was expecting. The doctor decided to go in a totally different way using  Botox instead of filler, and applying in a different area of my concerns. Instead of focusing on the area under my eyes, she said that putting Botox in my forehead would lift the entire face, smoothing the lines under the eyes and between my eyebrows. 

When I left to office I was surprised to see that my budget wasn't respected, and the total amount was 200 dollars over, which I immediately mentioned to the secretary.

Everything I requested was ignored, and whatever treatment was given to me wasn't at all what I wanted. 

I didn't pay want I wanted, I didn't get the results I wanted. When I reached the clinic to talk about my experience, the nurse said that it was my responsibility to tell the doctor about my budget, not hers. She interrupted me several times during the call, not letting me finish what I had to say, with a passive aggressive tone in her voice, and no solutions offered. 

Bad service, bad customer service, and a big waste of money. DO NOT RECOMMEND.I finally decided to go for a treatment for an issue I had since I was 24 and I was pleasantly surprised how quick and easy the treatment was and the staff are so nice and make you feel at home from the moment you arrive.  I was worried about where to park but they do have 2 hour parking in front and one hour parking across the street and I was done within 30 minutes.Feels like home! They took care of me when other doctors said they couldn’t help me. They did an amazing job! Very friendly, personable and welcoming!",business

Very excellent, knowledgeable staff! We the public are lucky to have such a great support system available to help us! To the New Start staff, you don't have to thank me for my review. The truth speaks for itself and it's I who am thankful for you all have been there for me over the years! Highly recommend you! HORRIBLE STAFF, RUDE and unhelpful. Don't even think of renting from them!!!Horrible company, horrible staff. never willing to help you out but always willing to do their best to screw you around. This company has poorly managed a building I own a unit in for 6+ years and I have nothing but problem after problem with them. I wouldn't recommend this company to any building owner and I feel sorry for anyone who has to be managed by them past, present or future. Found what I was looking for real easy  I give them a zero if I could, I've been seeing a doctor snow with the Family Vision Clinic on Tacoma drive for quite a long time. Come to find out all they care about is money, so after requesting some things of a medical nature I was given a letter today telling me don't come back to the clinic now the only reason clinics give out these letters is that they've done something wrong and they're trying to cover the tracks if you were smart you'd go somewhere else these people don't care about their patients all they care about is how much money they can get out of themThe first time I went to this clinic was about three years ago - for a simple eye exam and, likely, to order new glasses. I had the exam, picked out a set of frames and they also said that they would order in a set of frames for sunglasses for me to look at. Not having heard anything for three weeks after that, i stopped by the clinic. the only record they has was of my exam. Finally, after much searching they found a basket with my prescription, the frames that I had chosen and a note saying that I was going to think about the frames (??!!??) Nothing had been done about sunglasses. I did get prescription sunglasses,. But, after two years one lens was badly scratched, so I took the sunglasses to this clinic. A new lens was ordered (my sunglasses were sent off to have it fitted in the frame.) When it came back I was told that the employee had decided to get both lenses replaced, ""so that they would both be new"" or words to that effect. unfortunately, i also let that slide. However, that second lens never fit right and it kept falling out. Recently it felt and I lost it, so I simply put in the old lens (which fits fine and has no defects.)
Last week I got a call that it was time for the annual exam regarding cataracts. One set of tests involved switching between lenses to see whether I could see any differences. Unfortunately, the employee  who was administering the tests seemed to be in something of a hurry - at least for that last set. Several times when i was asked  which lens was clearer for me, as they were rotated through, it was done so quickly that I was unable to determine whether or not I was actually able to see better with one, versus the other, of the pairs that I was supposed to compare. Finally i had to say something more than that I was unable to make the comparison, as it became clear to me that she was writing down that I did not perceive any differences, rather than that I may well have been able to perceive some differences IF I HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO LOOK AT THEM FOR MORE THAN A SPLIT SECOND .I've now been referred to a medical specialist and will have to explain to that doctor about that flawed testing just in case my future treatment might otherwise be based in part on incorrect information.
Having said all of this, none of the staff at this office have ever been anything but pleasant .This business would not stand by their eye evaluation with me. I did not buy lenses right away because I found them quite expensive. instead a few months later I bought lenses at costco because of good prices. But I could not adjust to the new lenses. I went back to costco to make sure the prescription was correct. The lenses were correct so they offered to double check the eye exam and found different results (healthier eyes). When I brought this to the attention of Family Vision Clinic they tried to book me in for another evaluation at full price. asking why they seemed unconcerned with different exam results they cited a 3 month policy. Your eyes probably changed they said. over a couple months my eyes got healthier ok. Even if they did, would they not want me to be satisfied with the service they provide. apparently not unless im willing to pay again. Well if im paying again why not go with a third party that hasn't potentially screwed up. sigh, whatever happen to customer service and standing by your product. 

I found the initial eye exam rushed and it seemed they were more concerned with trying to sell me lenses. which didn't bother me at the time but in retrospect bothers me because of the differing results. 

Long story short im out a few hundred dollars with a pair of glasses that make me dizzy to wear. Their lack of interest in the differing eye exams shows a lack of professionalism. and their lack of sympathy to my situation and satisfaction shows something more concerning. I could not recommend this place with any faith. Sure they are probably fine 90% of the time but do you want to be that odd one out and left hung out to dry like me. I've only ever had the club wrap, but it's so delicious. I get one every time I'm in the building (if the cafe is open). 

5 star service too, everyone is amazing there.Pizza is alright but the wraps are where it's at. Also best $5 burger and fries in the citySo far I've had the poutine and Mexican breakfast wrap.  Sooo good!! Cant wait to try all the stuff they have on their menu!!!

"I have had 4 children attend Mother Hubbard’s, and I’m not sure why I never wrote a review. Laurie and Sheila are amazing. Sheila made me feel welcome from day one until my last little one left there (5 ish years). Laurie is very special to me. There are many times I would come pick up my kids and find her cuddling my little ones and just playing with the kids. 

My children loved it there !!! Even after they started school they wanted to go to daycare. The teachers in all classrooms are outstanding. They actually care for the children and take pride in their work. They make activities for the kids in their spare time and have theme weeks and outings for the kids. They take the kids out for play time rain or shine (within limits of course) which is great.  

Everyone at Mother Hubbard’s has not treated my kids as if they were just regular children in a daycare, they were treated like family. Every teacher knew every child, and they loved them and constantly asked about them even when they moved on to school. I have also witnessed them doing the same for all children. 

I could honestly go on and on about this little hidden gem! Honestly if it’s a little far from your house - go the extra distance. You will not be disappointed. 

Special thank you to all the amazing staff Julie, Stephanie, Kyla, Brandie, Katherine, Caitlyn, Allison, and everyone I missed for helping me raise my little humans ❤️My 14 month old son started 4 weeks ago and now loves it there.  The staff are excellentDesert I met Tony some time ago,  and since the first day of asking him for some help with getting my bike running Perfect he was always ready to assist with all my issues.  Misfires and sluggishness. 
Hes a fantastic mechanic and very knowledgeable. 
I recommend him for any issues that anyone could bring to the table.  
100%I heard bad things about this place but I could not take the negativity any longer.
I stopped in to check it out myself and was amazed at the service.
My lights were all messed up for MVI, Tony the owner fixed the lights and fixed my brake switch all for 20$ (even worked 30 mins after closing).I ended up giving 50$ for the amazing service to get me back on the road.
He told me his life story and the problems he had starting out with another worker that took over for him while he was very ill. People can be so negative without understanding what was going on.
I will recommend tony and his crew to anyone. Definitely not out to take your money, I felt like I made a new friend today.
Thanks, AndrewAmazing service and skill. 5 star service for all your motorcycle needs. What a great school this is! Attended long enough to attain my first belt and perhaps one day will go back to continue learning more. Classes always involved a lot of well-rounded exercise (I learned so much about exercising/stretching in my time here and it has served me very well since). Self-defense is based on reality and teaches you very effectively. Brenna and Dave are gems - truly great people who care about you reaching your goals and are very welcoming and friendly. No two classes were ever the same and you can't find this variety at your local gym! Thanks guys!My children have been attending Sackville Kung Fu for almost 2 years.  My son is very high energy and hates sports, this is the only activity he has ever been in that he actually loves.  The instructors are great with the children and work with all their individual needs.Trained here for years, great for getting into shape and learning a traditional martial art focused on self defense. I went to a cooperate group training here. It was 6 week 2hrs a week, in this time I saw major changes in my physical appearance. As well my strength and endurance increased! Highly recommend checking them out, super affordableGreat gym! I have lymphedema and the trainer worked around my limitations and has made me go from a person who was going to have to go on disability to someone who is active. He gave me my life back!Ryan is a great trainer! He pushes you beyond what you think you can do, and you leave feeling sore, tired, but confident in yourself ❤️",business

"Kristine was attentive, friendly and helped me to better understand why my muscles hurt the way they did.  I'm now better able to do my job without as much pain in my daily routine. I'd definitely recommend her to anyone.I went to see David and he is amazing! I can't get over how great he was. I've been in pain for 9 years due to an accident while I was a passenger on one of the Metro Transit buses, and in just one appointment with David I experienced tremendous relief. I will be seeing him regularly for sure. 
The staff at Massage experts are very friendly and professional and I would recommend them to anybody I know who needs/is looking for a massage.Massage Experts is very expensive compared to other places even with health insurance. 
The environment at Massage Experts is set up for massages, nicely decorated  and looks clean. The massage therapists however that I saw were NOT good at giving massages. I won't be going back anymore. A few days ago, I ordered an arrangement of roses from Flower Trends, for my moms birthday. She absolutely loves them! Flower Trends is my go-to flower store, for every occasion. They have the best quality flowers, of course, but what I like the most about them is they are experts at customer service and delivering value. They will go the extra mile for you, every time. Thank you Flower Trends Florists.Roxanna designed the most beautiful flower arch, bouquets and boutonnieres for our wedding this August! She was amazing to work with and really listened to what we were looking for. Thank-you so much! We loved the flowers on our wedding day.Flowers were apparently lovely and delivery very prompt. Will order again from this florist. Excellent store for the young budding reader. With sections clearly labeled to help you find the age appropriate novels for your children. Great selection of books, novels, toys and plush toys to stimulate the imagination of the children.Great selection of books, service was great.  The sales person was helpful and mentioned that they could order certain selections in if they didn't have them in store.  The toy selections was not as extensive as the books, but there were different items that I didn't see in other stores.Great service and a wide selection of items
 Books, toys, and lego to name a few. Certainly store for any adult interested in finding items to help enlighten children. When I first walked in I didn't expect much considering the past few times I got my nails done at different places they butchered them and were over priced garbage. These guys at T.A Nails know exactly what they are doing!! My nails are so shiny and smooth! The guy who did them for me was very nice as well!! I only paid 60 bucks and it was well worth it in my opinion. I WILL be going back!i would rate this place a five after going a few hours ago! The service was great and he was always asking how i was doing and telling me what he was about to proceed with. The place was VERY CLEAN and you know that because right after getting them done and dried they brush off the access and ask you to go wash your hands. (It took around 45 minutes for them to be complete) He was not one of those people who talked to the other worker the whole time or one  of those people who didnt talk at all, he started conversations when necessary and told me advice on maintaining the nails. Most of all I LOVE THEM!This place is amazing for getting nails done.the people will treat you like family, and the employees are super nice!! I found the great deal they advertised and purchased it. It was amazing.Perfect day to take the bus over! Wherever I went, I received good help in the stores. The heat outside also helped. :)The Woodlawn plaza is a good place they have the Giant tiger / Staples the bargain barn and lots of other shops there I go there a couple times a month to shop for things.",business

"Overheard that  they sometimes serve canned food  and mix them with rice for the lunch.Oh my goodness, I love this daycare and it's workers! I have been so happy with them and my son has been so lucky to have spent the last (almost) year there!my little 4 years boy had been in this  great daycare for 2 years , it was a great time he spent there with learning a lot of skills such as two language English and Mandarin , in the mean time by the age of 2 he already knew all the alphabet letters in small and capital , it is really pure education centre ,don't hesitate to take your child to that daycare , the teachers are very nice  and treat my child well , unfortunately we had to move to Edmonton , in fact we are not able to find a good one as a little lady bugs .  The new seats are a tremendous improvement over the old wooden pews. Beautiful stained glass. Cozy place to take in a concert.Playing cards and people who work thereBig. Very big. Home to Halifax.

"I registered in a class then they canceled the class no body even called me ...I got 1 day off and arrived there at 7 in the morning nobody was there....
I asked for my money back they said we dont return money we put it under you're account ...so I was have to buy 300$ product from them...
I never suggest this place ...Friendly staff with a great classroom, well stocked for an enjoyable learning experience.I have known Anna and her wonderful staff for 10 years.  It has been an absolute exciting experience growing as an Aesthetician and learning all that Anna has to offer.  The quality of the products offered are of superior quality and can be found no where else.
I know my clients are receiving the best in Spa products and only offer the best to my clients.
Anna's Discover Learning Center is a comfortable and phenomenal place to grow in professional knowledge as well as make professional connections.  I look forward to working with Anna and her team for the next 10+ years  I cannot say enough great things about this daycare, particularly the infant room my son is in. They are so great with him. I love how they look forward to seeing him, are great about sharing his day at pickup and calmed my fears when he first started. I'd give 6 stars if I could.",business
Tried the goodies at the farmers markets. The pastries are tasty and nicely sized! The scones were my go to. Especially the blueberry.  The pricing could offer some deals. We bought 4 scones and had to pay individual pricing for each— a lil incentive to buy is always nice for customers!! Otherwise Good service and smiling ladies always greeting you!!The glazed apple strudel is wonderful!! Everything else looks delicious as well!,business

"Boys did a great job answering all questions and were very knowledgeable and friendly!We had major root problems on the city side of our sewar pipe. The city sent in Cornell to rectify the situation. Impressed is an understatement of my experience. The crew (Jarred and Josh) were very polite, professional and did great work. They were punctual and answered all of my questions (I was quite curious). ZERO MESS!!! They also provided me with video proof I can provide to my insurance (the get coverage). I don't leave many reviews, and never heard of them before they showed up at my door. That said, I would recommend them in a heartbeat.Little delayed on getting report but great service",business

Nice people. The second floor of this building is not wheelchair accessible so you can't get to see your kids if you're in a wheelchair and if your kids are in a wheelchair it's not accessible to them at all.

"My 8 year old daughter has gone here on and off for the past 3 years and I've never had a bad experience. The only reason she's not there permanently is that Excel is cheaper and more convenient during the school year.  I wish I would have known about this place earlier on.  They are always very welcoming, do lots of activities and have lots of outdoor time.  The place is always fresh and clean and well maintained.Future Stars' Learning Centre is an incredible daycare with the most supporting staff. There are so many educational activities that they provide on a daily basis that have shown that the staff truly care about the children's learning. The staff work hard to ensure that they are providing the best care for the children, and any communication with parents are fast and reliable. The daycare also goes on many field trips that enhance their learning while maintaining a safe and fun space.

"Pretty good! Clean and very pretty! Loved visiting alot.Lovely church,great choir. Plenty of parking.Church and hall If you  are looking for authentic Montessori, this is not a good school . Unfortunately i have to pull off my 2 daughters from this school Midway of academic year .We put our daughters here as we moved from different location. My elder one who joined here at 5 Yrs was already from Authentic Montessori Who at 4 yrs did 4 digit complex additions  literally started forgetting all those.More importantly my kid was good at  cursive Writing and the school has not preserved that besides we discussed about this at the begining rather let/taught my daughter to write print letters. This is one of the main reason im writing review ,like when ever i see my kid writing print letters i get frustrated.Luckily now at her new school teachers encourage her to write in cursive and she picked up nicely.  At times they say this & that  will be  taught only in Grade 1 etc was really disappointing. Coz Montessori is the place or principle where you don't limit any kids but create a curiosity in them for learning things ahead.Younger one 3 yrs Old, all she could tell was she slept well in school than any thing else. Now in her new school she says numbers/words with in a month. I am happy that i pulled off my kids from this school. Besides,  this is a great day care, highly secured and process Oriented.But for authentic Montessori I would not recommend.",business

They have jars for sale if you forget) and refills on Down East Cleaners. I wish I lived closer so I could shop here more. There’s cereals, oatmeals, flour, pastry flour, prunes, raisins, and some prepackaged things like tahinis and sauces. All volunteer run.Great food, great people.  I get all my organic grains that I need for baking my own bread there for a reasonable price. I also like the philosophy of the grainery and the fact that you work instead of just paying for membership. So everyone is involved of making it better.",business

"This little gallery is participating in supporting and exposition of terrific, local photographers. Get in there you hipsters!The ViewPoint Gallery is a contemporary photography collective and gallery. This gallery has a new show monthly which always includes a reception and artist talk. A great place to view the printed image and discuss with any of the artists about their work; intimate and invaluable.
They have monthly print reviews to which you are invited either as a submitter or just to participate in the process. Something I look forward to attending sooner rather than later. Drop in sometime!The pictures are very amazing Love Dalhousie My wife is the owner 😊 Thornbloom is a fun home decor and housewares store. It reminded me of a Bowring type store but a little higher quality merch. I'd rate it moderately expensive, depending on the items, but at the same time you don't need to own a million dollar condo downtown to afford shopping there.

We went in late November so the store was in full on Christmas mode. It was beautiful! Very festive. Staff were friendly. All in all a good shopping experience.A little pricey but beautiful selection of decor and I especially loved their high quality & gorgeous bedding! Friendly staff! Will be buying more from here next visit!We've been dealing with Debbie and her staff at Thornbloom for more than 20 years in three locations, and they are our first choice for anything we need in our home, from a fine and durable coffee table (our first purchase) to kitchen ware, table ware, bedding of all sorts, and towels (our latest buy). We recommend them highly. -  Pat and Janice",business
"I am attending both group and individual therapy here and have never had a better relationship with the faculty of any mental health treatment center. You get back what you put into therapy. They are incredibly helpful and very supportive.Unique among treatment programs I've experienced because they force you to sign away your basic rights as a patient to participate in their program, when you're at your most desperate. Would not recommend to anyone. Feels as though I've been taken advantage ofA bit of a wait to see someone, but well worth it. Helped me through a very difficult time in my life. Scott was very accommodating and worked with me to find the best insurance option for my small business. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone.We switched to Stanhope Simpson 2 years ago and are so happy we did! Their staff is extremely knowledgeable (plus super friendly) and provides suggestions and options to make sure you are covered properly, but not paying more than you should be. They really know the industry! Their customer service is outstanding. Sometimes I would email a question and get an answer back within minutes. Highly recommend Stanhope Simpson!Jennifer has been so incredibly patient and helpful over the last couple of months! 
We ultimately decided to go with another insurer due to a significant price difference (and a student budget!) and ease of having our home and auto insurance together with the same insurer, but I will not hesitate to reach out to Stanhope Simpson for our future insurance needs. 

I felt genuinely taken care of and I really appreciated that. 

Thanks for restoring our faith in great service! Stacey was very helpful to get me placed in a good job!  Then she followed up after I started a new job to make sure I was fitting in and satisfied with the work. I would enlist her help again when the need arises!  Recommended!Working with talent works was an easy and wonderful process. They found me a position extremely quickly, and the staff are lovely and always quick with their communication. An overall great experience!Great staff and placements. Stacey was attentive and considered of my placements. I would recommend them if you are looking for part-time work or a flexible schedule.    We have used Roy twice to sell our home and to sell my mom's home on her passing.  Roy exhibits professionalism, courtesy, understanding and assists you in making decisions that are right for you with his vast knowledge of the real estate market and current trends.  He's to the point and up front in providing you with his advice.  His personality and smile, along with his many years' experience made selling both these properties just that much easier.  Would recommend him to any of our friends and family for sure.  Thanks Roy!!!!!Roy has wings hidden beneath those jackets.  Throughout the process of selling our home of 45 years, he became the essence of calm and reason in a storm of emotion.   We  have gained such insight into and appreciation for the far-reaching spider web of activity that goes on behind the scenes of selling a house.     I have also learned that selling a house is not just about selling a house - Roy became our educator, our sounding board, our cheerleader, our confidant, our link to necessary services, my psychologist.     A few of those attributes you can learn; the important ones are innate.    We are decent people who are delighted we chose Roy as our agent and delighted to learn that he is also a decent person who cares about his clients, has the obvious  respect of his peers, and the utmost gratitude of his many happy ""sold-iers"".  A+++ Roy.   Happy to add our most sincere thanks to that list!

Connie and Garry Brown My wife and I met Maged at an open house while doing some house hunting for family moving to the area.  Right away, his professionalism, sincerity, honesty and charming personality drew him to us.   While communicating with Maged during this process,  we knew right away that we were going to use Maged to sell our own house when the time came.  Within a couple of months we made the decision to sell.  Maged was very attentive to all of our needs and was extremely supportive through the whole process.  Our house was listed on a Monday and the next day, we had 3 offers and closed the deal at above asking.  We firmly believe that his contacts, his photographer and his professionalism led to the quick sale.  Maged was an absolute pleasure to work with in every aspect of the process.  Thank you so much for everything you did to make this such an enjoyable time for us!    Darryl and Tracy""I had the pleasure of working with Maged Aly. I was very impressed by his professionalism, personal attention and punctuality. When I was searching for a real state investment, Maged was able to accurately grasp what I was searching for and provided me with available market opportunities that perfectly fit my requirements. Maged carefully and patiently assessed several opportunities with me until we were able to find the opportunity that best matched what I was looking for. Maged immediately dealt with the sellers and his agent professionally and competently, while keeping me engaged in the process. Throughout the whole process, I felt Maged's first priority was to look out for my best interest. Thanks Maged and I look forward to more business dealings with you.""Maged recently helped my parents with the purchase of their new home and they only had great things to say about him. Our biggest concern was getting a bad deal or being taken advantage of, and I can honestly say I couldn't be more pleased with having Maged as their realtor. I am also writing this review on behalf of my parents since they don't have a google account and this is what my Dad had to say ""Maged is a very hard working person. He is a good negotiator and managed to get me a very good deal on the new house. For all my future buying and selling of property, I will keep Maged as my preferred realtor. At no point did I feel pressured and I felt Maged took adequate time to understand and then cater to what my wife and I were looking for. I will also be recommending him to others.""

"This school is not only stressful but the teachers are awful. Some teachers are amazing and perfect in my opinion an know how to handel hard situations but most teachers dont know what they're doing and force stress upon young kids who shouldn't even know what stress is! The vice principle hates kids and she inflicts fear in kids, she is now a teacher and god bless the kids who are in her class. They force the kids to go outside and refuse to let them use the bathroom in fear that the kids will skip recess because it is extremly cold outside. 

The after school programe is AMAZING but then all the good teachers left so now the ones running the after school program have no idea what to do beacuse they're new and its PANDEMONIUM! One teacher kicked a kid in the face because he was break dancing and told her to walk it off. 

I'm writing from my own personal expirience and i think they should step it up a notch, do better job please!Has to be the worst special needs school  I ever sent my child to or intrusted my son to them 
The PA are uncaring unprofessional and lacking anytype of experience when IT comes to tube feeds or anytype of interactions with the other children 
Which was very important to me .
Spending time in a small room with dim lighting isnt my idea of socializing sorry this school gets a 1 star I would give none if that was a option!! 
I have enroĺled my child in the ENGLISH school and omg what a big big big difference there caring kind and the experience I am searching for when it comes to my child with complex needs !! 
I am not sure where all the money goes in the french school system but its not spent on the special need program thats forsure ...... Think really hard before you put your child into this school of they have anytype of learning or complex needs because they surly wont get it here also the school is run by a bunch of bamboons they know nothing what it takes to look after a special need child the school went down hill when original principal Kevin left to teach at another school !!

"There are so many options for everyone I have come in with, the wildcard pizza and salad options are both always great. They're also really good with helping with different options to accommodate all of my allergies! Has become a regular spot my family.What I love about this place is you don't need to be vegan or vegetarian to enjoy the food. Their menu has something for everyone! The portions are generous, prices are on par with other veg spots around, and they offer daily specials which are always delicious! My only complaint would be the interior of the restaurant is pretty stuffy in the summer time. Not sure if they have A/C or maybe it was broken the day we were there but it was so muggy we opted to sit outside (in the rain) to escape the heat. Food wise though, the place is incredible!The food was so good... I didn't think a salad could taste that amazing, but it did! 😍🥰",business
"In the past month, we've been in to the store 3 times to use the print and copy services at this location. Each time there has been an issue with attachments not working or the files being too big for the print me app that an employee had to help us each time. Thankfully for us that super helpful employee was Dru! Dru, you saved us so much time and frustration; thank you so so much for all your help, knowledge and friendly service. I was so happy to see that you were working the second and third times we visited the store because I knew we would have everything done quickly, efficiently and from someone who has great customer service.Frustrating experience at Staples today. I’m not a regular customer so I’m not super familiar with their print services but as a designated Purolator drop-off location, I will occasionally drop packages there. During a previous visit, I was told how to email a label for printing. I completed this step prior to arriving to expedite the process. 

There was a line when I arrived with 2 people in front of me and several people followed behind me. At one point, the gentleman behind the counter asked me to wait at the shipping counter if I had a parcel. He called over for extra help and the other associate proceeded to help everyone in line but me. Benefit of the doubt - maybe the other associate didn’t know how to do shipping? Fair enough. 

When the first associate finally came over, I was told that I should be printing the label myself. I explained that on a previous visit the associate looked after that part but I was happy to learn for future visits if he could show me. He said he could show me if I “want to wait behind everyone else in line”. I didn’t get upset but I must’ve said something sarcastic because he finally decided to be helpful and printed the label I had prepared ahead of time.

Now, I fully understand retail and that the store doesn’t technically make any money from Purolator and FedEx drop-offs. And maybe the staff have been told not to give any priority or proper customer service to their shipping customers. I would think Purolator and FedEx would be interested in knowing this if that were the case. 

End of the day, my parcel got shipped (or will be, I guess) but I’m no further ahead in my understanding of how this process works. If they want to be helpful and print labels for customers, I’m very confused at this interaction. If I’m supposed to print my own labels, I’m no further ahead after today either. So, I’m likely destined for a future experience very similar to the one I had today...Absolutely great customer service!  Went there to do some printing/copying...machine jammed up so the staffer not only made our copies for us but gave us some bonus copies for free for our trouble/inconvenience.  So great to exceed expectations and be willing to do so without any request or complaints - just did the right thing!  As businesses should!  So good!!!  Thank you Staples!!!

 Books, toys, and lego to name a few. Certainly store for any adult interested in finding items to help enlighten children. When I first walked in I didn't expect much considering the past few times I got my nails done at different places they butchered them and were over priced garbage. These guys at T.A Nails know exactly what they are doing!! My nails are so shiny and smooth! The guy who did them for me was very nice as well!! I only paid 60 bucks and it was well worth it in my opinion. I WILL be going back!i would rate this place a five after going a few hours ago! The service was great and he was always asking how i was doing and telling me what he was about to proceed with. The place was VERY CLEAN and you know that because right after getting them done and dried they brush off the access and ask you to go wash your hands. (It took around 45 minutes for them to be complete) He was not one of those people who talked to the other worker the whole time or one  of those people who didnt talk at all, he started conversations when necessary and told me advice on maintaining the nails. Most of all I LOVE THEM!This place is amazing for getting nails done.the people will treat you like family, and the employees are super nice!! I found the great deal they advertised and purchased it. It was amazing.Perfect day to take the bus over! Wherever I went, I received good help in the stores. The heat outside also helped. :)The Woodlawn plaza is a good place they have the Giant tiger / Staples the bargain barn and lots of other shops there I go there a couple times a month to shop for things. I've been going here for years now, and from eye exams - to frames, lenses, and contacts they've been amazing all around. 
Great quality products and always friendly service.My 90-yr-old parents (both with dementia) didn't even buy their glasses at Vogue, but when they got broken, Vogue fixed them anyway and didn't even charge us anything!  They seemed genuinely concerned about helping out someone in need, and were just super nice people.  Needless to say, when Mom needed new glasses, we went there and they were very kind and patient with her.  These folks not only know how to provide good best customer service but how to be really decent human beings, tooWhat an amazing experience! The staff was friendly and very helpful and the prices are fantastic! I left very happy and feeling like I got a great deal on something I needed to buy. They were also able to get my glasses done very fast and were very organized and efficient. World Gym Dartmouth is an amazing gym with the best trainers and great equipment. 

I have been doing personal training there since the day it opened with Aaron McDonald. I actually left my previous gym to follow him here as we have been a team over 14 months now and he will always be  my trainer to keep me on track as he and I both know I need the accountability to stay on track. In a year I have lost 70 lbs with his help. He takes his job to heart and truly wants to see his clients reach their goals. If something isn't working, he will change the plan to fit you so the goals can be reached.  The equipment that they have has allowed Aaron to be able to push me to my limits by targeting certain muscles to get the results that I desire and to allow me to reach my goals. I am so thankful that I have met Aaron and that he has become such an important part of my life. I will always be grateful to him as he has helped changed my life for the better forever and that is something I can never repay him for. If you want results and will be true to yourself then I recommend Aaron as you will get those results if the work is put in that needs to be done! Aaron can't change you but he can help guide you so you can change you to get to your goals!I'm so excited this gym has opened! Brand new and the equipment is great! Lots of different pricing levels starting at only $6 bi-weekly for the basics which is enough unless you're into serious training. Childcare offered on site during your workout. No-hassle refund and cancellation policies. Great rates on personal training compared to other gyms in town. Keep it up!Love this gym !! It's a great atmosphere and its building a great community Dr Cruz is a highly skilled professional, who not only offers excellent eye health support,  but has an excellent ""Newfoundland"" caring personality. He doesn't talk at you, but discusses each concern in a caring personable manner. You feel he really cares. Dr Cruz has taken excellent care of us for many years. You can take his counsel to the bank. Gene and Marilyn Antle. Excellent customer service, and excellent haircutWas not there This place is magical. I love to see food be treated the right way. Take what you will eat and that's all. No huge packs no waste, beautiful. Better yet its way cheaper to buy some items here. 👍Lots of gluten and dairy free products, always new products and very well laid out store. Love shopping there and excellent staff.Bulk Barn is a go-to shopping destination for me. I find all the unusual stuff I'm looking for, in bulk, which I can put into my own containers and pass on the plastic bags. I find the prices reasonable and the quantities purchased are completely up to you. I've never been disappointed shopping at Bulk Barn. And if you're looking for something uncommon to satisfy a particular diet, in all likelihood, you'll find it here. Some of the not-so-common things I purchase, for example, are Buckwheat Honey, Corn Flour, Arrowroot, Brown or White rice flour, xanthan and guar... plus a whole section of candies and treats if you feel like being a little on the dietary wild side. Check it out! (Yes, this is an unsolicited, objective review!) A great service  very happy with what I got done .   friendly  professional and great quality

Thank you Mr Crowell Bright, clean store with lots of selection.   I don't sew near as much as I used to so I can't comment on the prices.Really great staff and management. A pleasure to deal with!Great store. Friendly staff and well laid out. My son has been going here since he was 5 months old and he LOVES it. He has learned so much and the staff are excellent! Highly recommend!Way over priced for the quality of care. My daughter is sent home almost daily and I'm left to pay a baby sitter and the daycare bill.Both of my kids spent the entire duration at this daycare and I can't say enough great things about the staff and the facilities there. Amazing group of people working there. They prepared both of my children for school and they made a lot of great friends there. Great location and very flexible and caring atmosphere. The Tiger is always great fun for shopping. The selection of products is excellent, you can find things here that are unique to the store, and priced for great value. The clothes are stylish, and affordable; the produce mostly Canadian, which makes me happier to spend there; and there's a lovely range of gifts and goodies all year round.good prices  watch  out for the  veg  they can be outLove this Giant tiger.  Staff friendly and helpful. Staff is super helpful and knowledgeable. Great experienceThe Sally's Team is always Friendly & Helpful.The staff are so nice, and extremely helpful! I don’t usually write reviews but you guys rock, love my hair extensions ;) Not a bad place but they do not offer direct billing to your insurance company which is a minor inconvenience.

"My kid went here like a decade ago and we had an awful experience. They served the kids cheese on buns and my kid threw up when he came home! The playground equipment was filthy and my kid was full of dirt on that day! The staff were very mean! And the hygiene was awful indoors too! They also gave my kid a nap when he was four years old and he could barely sleep that night! Never again! If you're a parent, get a refund ASAP!",business

"Our son was here for a few years, the experience was fabulous. He received great care, loved the activities, flexible pick-up & drop off times, the *only* place we could find that didn't make us pay full time even when our son was there part-time sometimes. Bethany is incredible. Loved that there was an in-house chef so we knew our son was getting nutritious food & loved that he was exposed to different food textures & spices. A very special place where everyone takes their job seriously.Contacted the company, got their generic email with attachments but had other questions. I emailed a few times and even called and left a message. Have yet to hear from anyone and that was months ago. If time can’t be made for me then how is time managed with the kids? No thanks!!We dropped by for an advertised Open House (for which we had confirmed our attendance) this past Saturday.  The place was locked up tight.  Another family told us they had been stood-up last year too.  I wasn't impressed with the outdoor play area and obviously have concerns about communication and general business practices. Dan and his colleague Pool did an appraisal of my large coin collection.  Very friendly and very informative.  Highly recommend going to see these two kind gentlemen.I had a great experience here today. The owner is a sweet, understanding and respectful older gentleman . He explained the whole process to me, answered my questions, showed me all the numbers and rates and was very fair. Women especially, if you are looking to sell gold, this is a safe place to go.Dan is the man! He has incredible knowledge and went above and beyond simply selling gold or silver.",business
"Boys did a great job answering all questions and were very knowledgeable and friendly!We had major root problems on the city side of our sewar pipe. The city sent in Cornell to rectify the situation. Impressed is an understatement of my experience. The crew (Jarred and Josh) were very polite, professional and did great work. They were punctual and answered all of my questions (I was quite curious). ZERO MESS!!! They also provided me with video proof I can provide to my insurance (the get coverage). I don't leave many reviews, and never heard of them before they showed up at my door. That said, I would recommend them in a heartbeat.Little delayed on getting report but great service",business

"Small but well kept- great hidden museumLuv the fishI love studying in this beautiful museum (if a bit creepy). It's very small and tucked into the bottom of the LSC. I really enjoyed their customer service. A nice place to meet your needs. Always ready to serve.asked for peppermint tea with honey, they did 1 peppermint, 1 honey lemon, when I noticed and pointed it out they insisted it was just peppermint (never mind the labeled tea bag that says honey lemon apparently), and then when they gave it to me they said ""peppermint with lemon""......... oh and added bonus, when I said I actually wanted honey but it's OK, employee said ""hey I just work here don't get mad at me.""

"Hoda and her team are fantastic! We took our son to Care and Fun for two years and the dedication and support that they give is amazing.  The team there is very friendly and very well trained. 
I have an extremely picky eater and my son love the choices he had there. He loved his outside play. He wants to go back to see his friends including his teachers.I started bringing both my children, 4 yrs and 6.5 M in September 2015 to the Main Street location and I have been very pleased with the service and caregivers.  My children developed strong relationships with their caregivers, and while my oldest has moved on to school he sometimes goes back on PD days and still loves the food.  I have very picky eaters and they love the menu, and in fact always ask me to make Care and Fun's lentil soup.  They go outside everyday, unless it is freezing outside.  There is a large park in the back of the building, and the older kids go on field trips from time to time to the library or larger parks when the weather is nice.  I have found them very accommodating and easy to communicate with.  A while ago there were people parking in the Fire Lane outside the building, making it difficult for others to drive in and drop off or pick up their kids, even though there is ample parking.  They resolved the issue quickly and respond fairly to concerns about safety. I am extremely pleased with the Care & Fun's staff, facilities, menu, services and location and I would recommend them to anyone in need of child care.Our 2 kids were in the main ave branch from 2014 to 2016. We like the activities of the daycare, baking class,  doing craft, taking bus for a trip and going for trail. They had fun everyday. The teachers are nice as well.",business
"The best thing we did  for our company was contact Smiledog !!  It is so reassuring to know that friendly  and knowledgable people have been  answering our  calls for us . We have had many clients comment on how ""sweet"" the girls were at our office !! Brittany & Lisa respond to every email quickly when I need them and we truly appreciate them and all the Smile Gals  for there  professionalism and dedication to our company. 3 years have gone by fast and looking forward to many more .   Michelle BrewerSmiledog remote receptionist service is really great. I became Smiledog’ s customer soon after I started a massage therapy, physiotherapy and acupuncture clinic toward the end of 2011. We have been very happy with the services of Smiledog “Your Receptionist” over the past 6 and a half years. I visited the headquarter office this summer time, and was able to meet and shake hands with so many charming and lovely girls there-23 of them! Their office is spacious and beautifully. Impressive!!!Incredible customer service,  receptionists go above and beyond to help and have always been friendly and eager to help. It is truly refreshing to have a service that brings the human touch back to customer service. It is comforting to know that you are speaking with a real person and not an automated service. I would highly recommend this company to anyone.  Great staff..knowledgeable, professional and experienced. Always on time and caring. A shout out to Cecelia, a wonderful massage therapist. Would recommend this placeIve been here for both massage therapy and chiropractic appointments. Both have helped tremendously with the pain I used to have in my leg, lower and upper back. I  highly recommend going here! All the staff are very friendly as well.These people really care and it shows. I arrived for my first appointment barely able to walk. The ladies in reception were so sweet!  Dr Alex Vanderlinden is very knowledgeable
and kind, and I felt very comfortable working with him. I felt like he cared about me as a real person with pain, rather than just a patient. There were parts of my body that I didn’t even know were in need of adjustments, and it made a huge difference in pain that I’ve dealt with for years! Physiotherapist Yolanda Pinedo is second to none! If you need help to manage your pain for good, Yolanda’s the best! I’m now in control of my pain, and back to living. Highly incompetent tellers. First chit chated with a person for 5 minutes while I was on the line, then refused to change my money because I don't have an account with the bank. Will never go again.Loren is professional at what she is doing, and she provide great client experienceService used to be great. The past 18 months has been horrendous. The newer staff are so cold and Service is strictly perfunctory.  No hello, No how are you, NO smiles ever = NO welcome. Just A silent shell of a business now when you walk in the door.  It has deteriorated to such a degree that they even had to decrease their hours of operation.  You get more personalized service from the ATM there - at least the scratches & dings on the front of the ATM has some familiarity.  I actually feel sad for the place, because I used to think of them as a 6 out of 5. I have used Kimball Law twice now and both my partner and myself were extremely satisfied with our experience.  Not only did we receive top notch legal service, they were friendly, patient  and responsive to our many questions.  I honestly feel they went above and beyond to make buying our first  home a pleasant experience.   I would highly recommend Kimball Law to anyone looking for an accomplished and  knowledgeable law firm with a very personal approach.I have been working with Kimball Law for 18 years. Heidi has handled both personal and professional services for me and I’ve always been treated with care. She and her support team are professional and thorough while being ever mindful of all possible approaches to handle legal matters. They will always be my choicen practice for discreet and expert advice on real estate, business and personal legal services.Kimball Law represented me in family court and made the experience very easy.  They worked with me and made sure I understood everything through the whole process and got me what was fair.  Would highly recommend them.  Been with them for years. Connie always does a good job and is very nice.",business

"I have interacted with both Brennan and Danielle and find them both to be professional and competent. I would not hesitate in recommending either of them.Best real estate lawyer in HalifaxI hired Brennan Lejean. 
I’m not even sure where to express most of my disappointment. Should I begin with the lack of correspondence? (I’m talking weeks to respond), or perhaps I should begin with when Mr.Lejean forgetting about my court date? Or maybe how I made it into the court room and he was unprepared and had no numbers ran or cross referenced before getting in front of a judge, no, I think a better starting point is how he was always able to talk around the actual points and my actual requests telling me one thing and doing another. I gave him my retainer and I was thinking that once that was used I would be informed so that I could top it up. I wasn't informed until I requested an invoice a month after everything was completed and I owe triple the amount - I'm a single mom, so it was important that I stay on top of things financially.  
All in all lesson learned. For those of you reading this - find an experienced, passionate lawyer. Someone who understands how important your children are.  Go out and meet multiple lawyers before deciding. I felt having a younger lawyer would have been great - someone on the ball, someone eager to ""get in to the ring so to say"", and to keep me informed along the way but I was wrong. I’m sure not all lawyers starting out are like this but my experience with Brennan leaves a lot to be desired. Unfortunately - I would most definitely NOT recommend.  ",business

"This probably the best Chinese restaurant in Halifax. Strongly recommended.  Food is great and good service.  Very busy little place but worth trying.Really great Chinese food. We visit every year from Toronto and never fail to make it a stop. Chef Peter always makes it worth the trip. Fantastic and authentic.With a heavy-heart I have to say that it was not what I expected. From the reviews and recommendations, I was expecting some really authentic Chinese food yet I have to admit it was not I was expecting at all. I was really disappointed with the house fried rice especially as it is a good measure of a good Chinese restaurant... So the search is on for better Chinese cuisine in HRM. Gave my wife & Grandson a great hair cutMy son just got his haircut there and they did a total hack job and charged him $20 for it!!! Now I have to pay another $20 or more to get it fixed by a proper hair cutter!!! Highly recommend this place is you’re looking for a hack job!!!!Convenient and friendly. Don't be shy to tell them how you like your hair cut. Very friendly staff. One the the best sushi place in Halifax! Delicious fresh sushi with an amazing staff at your service. The owner is very friendly. Every time I visit Halifax, I make an effort of eating here and enjoying all their special rolls. Their ramen are delicious as well. I'd recommend this place over any other sushi restaurant in Halifax.First rate sushi. Only had takeout but it was excellent value and super fresh. Even had a sweet potato tempura as an extra. Little hard to get to but well worth the trip!Had this place recommended by a friend who really knows sushi and it did not disappoint. I went there with a large group at lunch time the service  was very good and speedy even though the place was full. Highly recommended. Great staff that are constantly getting professional development to better their skills.Really like the folks and service received at Glenbourne.

I had never had chiropractic work, and Dr Peddle has walked me through things to ensure wellneaa. Everyone is friendly, the space is clean and it seems to me that they are using top not technology.

Thumbs up all aroundDr. Fox has been my chiropractor since 2004 and he and the entire staff at Glenbourse are amazing! Mary Beth is a great RMT and also helped me through two pregnancies with her Doula skills! Not a lot of recent reviews so I figured I would drop one here. I moved to the area about 7 months ago, and frequent the store on a regular basis. There are several convenience stores around... A Circle K at the top of the road, a gas station store, pharmacy, and Sobeys express down Farnham Gate. Sobeys Extra on Lacewood, Rick's and another Circle K across from it. Point being, if I didn't like it, there are plenty of options.

I go here because I feel comfortable going here. The staff is very inviting, and it is always easy to find exactly what you are looking for. They also don't have a HUGE mark-up like you would expect from say a Needs or Circle K. Sure there is a little bit, but it is a convenience store.

They also carry some snack foods that I have always enjoyed, which you can't find outside of Asian Grocery stores.

I have read a few bad reviews here, regarding employee consistency, and bad habbits. These are older reviews though, and if they were accurate, they aren't any longer.

The workers of V&E take pride in running a business, and it is very rare that I have been in there and have it be empty. So I can't be the only person that thinks its a store worth visiting.

- 07/12/19I thought you guys should be fair to these girls in this store. Last week when I was there for my milk, the girl squeeze the bottle to make sure the milk is good. She told me that they can return any spoiled milk to Farmers without fees. Why don’t you just go back to the store and solve the problem face to face? The owner might get hurt by your comments here. You don’t even give her a chance to explain.Very friendly, the shop is under the care of the girls, a lot of clean and tidy, I want the groceries can be bought basically. Have any groceries you need, talk to the girls, and they're getting in soon. By the way, I like their smiles. The staff are ABSOLUTELY  amazing!
I made a mistake with my own order, and they were so amazing when it came to fixing it. I order from them all the time and I have never been disappointed! Thank you!!!!I had pizza from Domino's my first week in Halifax City ,I must say it's different from what I'm familiar with at home yet that different is a good different. I was pleasantly surprised at the quick online ordering and delivery service. I'm just waiting to order again now .... Two thumbs upNot bad for franchise pizza. Service were quick for pickup and delivery were also available for their clients. Taste were good to acceptable. Prices were reasonable to good. The finished products for pickup were hot and fresh.
There's no eat in service or dinning. Waiting area is small and tight. Amble amount of parking and few handicap accessible parking were available. Janet Lee is one of the worst person and rude. She kicked my sister out because my mom was not there to take her. She didn’t even listen to my explanation. Janet is very rude, I can’t believe that Kunon is still keeping her after so many bad reviews about her. Even the Komon customer service won’t help. I contact them about Janet Lee and they did nothing to control her. Kumon is waste of your money and time.Janet Lee was condescending. A very rude person. This was a really bad experience for my son and I both.This was the worst experience of my life. Don’t waste your money. They are very friendly staff, helpful, professionals and very reasonable prices. I recommend that place for every tailoring works. There many payment options available there moreover, they are not gonna put you on waiting as many other Tailors , you can have hamming or trimming your pants without waiting for weeks. Just few days or less when they are busy, or they serve you right away when there availability.
I recommend that place, and I'm sure you won't regret that.
If you believe that, or agree with me press like on my feedback.
Thank you,The owner is super nice, held my dry cleaning for way longer than he had to, and did a great job. Highly recommended!Great place. The guy repaired my jeans for $5, had it ready the next day. Did a really good job on fixing the leg. Will definitely go there again for clothing repairs. Will recommend this place to anyone looking for clothing repairs. What a great experience.  I went in knowing what I wanted to purchase and purchased at a good price. They offer free lessons on how to use their sewing machines and have a free  drop-in class setting every second Tuesday where you can work on a personal project with your own machine and get advice if required.Friendly and has a bit of everything. Very helpful and friendlyExcellent company !!!  Wonderful caring staff who really know their products and the medical conditions they treat.  Excellent equipment as well.  Beautiful clean private offices for your consult.  So helpful if you have any issues with the CPAP equipment, with as many follow up visits as you need.  Great caring knowledgeable people who will support you with any issues you may have.  I highly recommend this company !!Wonderful staff, these people can truly make a difference if you're having trouble sleeping.  From the first visit to return follow up visits, you are always made to feel welcome and that they really care.  Highly recommended!! Dr. Tymoshenko's calm spirit puts you immediately at ease. When you give her a little information, she asks the right questions to hone in on the root of the problem. She has helped me with digestive issues and muscle problems from accidental injuries,  as well as diet choices for my general well being. I have recommended her to several friends and they have all been impressed with how quickly her treatments have abated their illnesses.I have seen Dr. Nadia Tymoshenko for a variety of different aliments over the past few years, and she has helped me rebuild my system to be the best and healthiest version of myself! Extremely friendly and easy to talk to, I would recommend for anyone looking for a naturopathic doctor in the HRM!As a colleague of Dr. Tymoshenko's, I've been very impressed with her dedication to her patients. She is very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend her. There is no way to contact the centre. I called on March 18th to book a tour, but they had a message from March 4th with regards to the storm and whether the centre will be open. It doesn't switch you to the other line, phone just cuts off and hangs up after. What does that say about the centre if one cannot bother to change the phone message and be available for communication? Their website is also posted but does not work and I could not find a facebook page for this center to message them. Sad as it seems like this place has really good reviews, but this kind of sloppiness with communication makes me wonder whether I want my child in the care of these people.We absolutely love It Takes A Village! (It was a bit rocky in the beginning as our son had extremely separation aniexty!) but is doing extremely well and is always so excited to go, loves his teachers, always talks about his friends. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure your child has an amazing experience. Very clean facility, friendly staff, affordable, and healthy snacks and lunch are included! They also cater to any dietary restrictions! (Halal for us) I cannot begin to express how thankful I am to have found It Takes a Village! :DMy child has attendee this center since January. We are so impressed by the level of care and love shown everyday by the staff who work there. we highly recommend this center. This facility in my opinion is the best.  You are a somebody to them.  You are looked after like you are a King or Queen.  They employees there are just No. 1 in my book.  They bend over backwards to help.

Thank you!!!!I had pizza from Domino's my first week in Halifax City ,I must say it's different from what I'm familiar with at home yet that different is a good different. I was pleasantly surprised at the quick online ordering and delivery service. I'm just waiting to order again now .... Two thumbs upNot bad for franchise pizza. Service were quick for pickup and delivery were also available for their clients. Taste were good to acceptable. Prices were reasonable to good. The finished products for pickup were hot and fresh.
There's no eat in service or dinning. Waiting area is small and tight. Amble amount of parking and few handicap accessible parking were available. Janet Lee is one of the worst person and rude. She kicked my sister out because my mom was not there to take her. She didn’t even listen to my explanation. Janet is very rude, I can’t believe that Kunon is still keeping her after so many bad reviews about her. Even the Komon customer service won’t help. I contact them about Janet Lee and they did nothing to control her. Kumon is waste of your money and time.Janet Lee was condescending. A very rude person. This was a really bad experience for my son and I both.This was the worst experience of my life. Don’t waste your money. They are very friendly staff, helpful, professionals and very reasonable prices. I recommend that place for every tailoring works. There many payment options available there moreover, they are not gonna put you on waiting as many other Tailors , you can have hamming or trimming your pants without waiting for weeks. Just few days or less when they are busy, or they serve you right away when there availability.
I recommend that place, and I'm sure you won't regret that.
If you believe that, or agree with me press like on my feedback.
Thank you,The owner is super nice, held my dry cleaning for way longer than he had to, and did a great job. Highly recommended!Great place. The guy repaired my jeans for $5, had it ready the next day. Did a really good job on fixing the leg. Will definitely go there again for clothing repairs. Will recommend this place to anyone looking for clothing repairs. What a great experience.  I went in knowing what I wanted to purchase and purchased at a good price. They offer free lessons on how to use their sewing machines and have a free  drop-in class setting every second Tuesday where you can work on a personal project with your own machine and get advice if required.Friendly and has a bit of everything. Very helpful and friendlyExcellent company !!!  Wonderful caring staff who really know their products and the medical conditions they treat.  Excellent equipment as well.  Beautiful clean private offices for your consult.  So helpful if you have any issues with the CPAP equipment, with as many follow up visits as you need.  Great caring knowledgeable people who will support you with any issues you may have.  I highly recommend this company !!Wonderful staff, these people can truly make a difference if you're having trouble sleeping.  From the first visit to return follow up visits, you are always made to feel welcome and that they really care.  Highly recommended!! Dr. Tymoshenko's calm spirit puts you immediately at ease. When you give her a little information, she asks the right questions to hone in on the root of the problem. She has helped me with digestive issues and muscle problems from accidental injuries,  as well as diet choices for my general well being. I have recommended her to several friends and they have all been impressed with how quickly her treatments have abated their illnesses.I have seen Dr. Nadia Tymoshenko for a variety of different aliments over the past few years, and she has helped me rebuild my system to be the best and healthiest version of myself! Extremely friendly and easy to talk to, I would recommend for anyone looking for a naturopathic doctor in the HRM!As a colleague of Dr. Tymoshenko's, I've been very impressed with her dedication to her patients. She is very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend her. There is no way to contact the centre. I called on March 18th to book a tour, but they had a message from March 4th with regards to the storm and whether the centre will be open. It doesn't switch you to the other line, phone just cuts off and hangs up after. What does that say about the centre if one cannot bother to change the phone message and be available for communication? Their website is also posted but does not work and I could not find a facebook page for this center to message them. Sad as it seems like this place has really good reviews, but this kind of sloppiness with communication makes me wonder whether I want my child in the care of these people.We absolutely love It Takes A Village! (It was a bit rocky in the beginning as our son had extremely separation aniexty!) but is doing extremely well and is always so excited to go, loves his teachers, always talks about his friends. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure your child has an amazing experience. Very clean facility, friendly staff, affordable, and healthy snacks and lunch are included! They also cater to any dietary restrictions! (Halal for us) I cannot begin to express how thankful I am to have found It Takes a Village! :DMy child has attendee this center since January. We are so impressed by the level of care and love shown everyday by the staff who work there. we highly recommend this center. This facility in my opinion is the best.  You are a somebody to them.  You are looked after like you are a King or Queen.  They employees there are just No. 1 in my book.  They bend over backwards to help. 

I know they did it for me!Helpful staffAmazing",business

"I have been living on this property for over an year now. Overall, the management is great. Debbie, the resident manager is super helpful and always found her when we needed help. The view to the ocean is pretty amazing and you could watch the cruise ships passing by in summer. The bus stops are a bit far and has only 1 bus that comes near to the building. The Point Pleasant Park is accessible within 5 minutes, that's a bonus. The only downside is the shipyard. The non-stop sound of trains will make your life miserable when you try to sleep at night especially if you have kids at home.water leakage during raining.

"Have been living here for about a year now, most of the reviews on her are from old management as I understand it. 

Angela and Bre do a great job, it's a large building so sometimes small jobs get left a bit but if it's anything major they are on it right away! 

Since living here they have updated many of the apartments! I find our floor is usually pretty clean, not sure about others. Plus amazing views.Worst place I have ever lived in my life. If you want to live with Hypocrite building managers,Weed smokers & cockroaches this is the best place in Halifax. And at last, forget your security deposit you will never get it back. Please dont get attracted with low rents of them.Angela Wegger , building manager, of Ridgeway Towers  and her daughter Bre are great for getting repairs done.  Sometimes it takes awhile due to reasons we are not aware of. The halls are clean and odors are only from other tenants cooking. Unfortunately, in today's world we have lost the ability to be patient. The ONLY reason I left was because of being on a pension and the rent was a little high. As before I think Angela does a great job. i dont feel i can trust them because only one person said it was good and i feel like they were over exaggerating. but its right by my house so i guess ill let them go thereExcellent care givers, wonderful ",business

"Lots of Community services and a world class Boxing Club and Coaching Team! With one on one Coaching attention and group attention. City of Lakes Boxing Club Coaching Team also train and professionally skill you no matter what direction you wish to travel in Boxing. Whether you Compete or not, your still Coached Professional Style Skills !This place used to be a local school. Its awesome that it was saved and turned into a community center. Its still serving the community.BEST. DAYCARE. HANDS DOWN! Barbra and Irene are wonderful and you will get a sense the moment you walk in that the people here actually care for the development and well being of your children.  They practice an INCLUSIVE environment and use curriculum from the PreK. My little loves the teachers and its nice to hear them all say good morning when we arrive. They are great at communication any will help you/child in any areas your children are struggling. I have been a student at the club for a number of years and throughly enjoy the program. Young or older there is plenty to learn by all. I like the concept of learn at your own pace and no pressure to produce. I'm over 60 and see no end to how far I can go. Great workout and beats having to go to physio . Excellent value both health and pocketbook wise....SteveThe instructors here are awesome! So dedicated and super patient with the kids. We are about to start our 3rd year this fall. Highly reccomend this place. It is a non profit organization that only raises money for the kids events, rent, and insurance.  The instructors are dedicated to teaching in a process orientated manner where the students learn technical details, not brute force.  Their main goal is for the students to be physically active, open minded,  always learning, and integrating previously learned techniques together.The instructors here are awesome! Very dedicated and super patient with the kids. We are about to start our 3rd year this fall. Highly reccomend this place. I really enjoyed the self defence class. Lots of practical information. All the instructors are friendly and very welcoming!I have taken the WASP course twice. I took it with each of my daughters and their best friends when they started junior high. It was a great class and a good workout too. Very emportant training for every woman.Absolutely loved the WASP workshop, so excited for the fall class to start!",business

" Great food court - very few stores for shopping.Great shops and boutiques. Great food area and great restaurants. Food wise there is something for everyone.The folks at Crombie are a class act Horrible people work here who are petty and have way too much time on their hands. They prohibited all family of employees from using the washrooms in the hallways citing security threats! That is because my 6 and 8 year old kids used them this summer and I am an employees wife.

But I am brown and obviously a security threat! I was confronted by one of the high ups with my 2 children after using the hallway washroom and aggressively questioned. Never have I seen any sign stating that washrooms are for employees only and that family are not allowed anywhere in the building. But now they are pulling this S&^%# out of no where because me ( a brown woman) and my 2 kids peed some A hole off. We inconvenienced the oh so busy government workers as we used the hallway washrooms.

Before my kids using the washrooms there was no problem.

What a disgrace! These (very scared goverment employees) are a prime example of power hungry, over privileged petty racists.

Welcome to Halifax...where the department of justice discriminates against people of color and children.",business

"By far, the best quality of post secondary education I've received! During my time at MSVU, I never felt like I was number or just another student. My professors were genuinely interested in me and my success. If you're going to spend thousands of dollars on getting an education, in my honest opinion, MSVU will give you the best return on your investment!My years at The Mount are treasured memories, I came away with a lot more than a degree - wonderful professors, small classes and high standards made for a great university education and experience.Horrible place to study. I would have given 1/4 if it was available. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for future success.",business

"I highly recommend Evergreen Dental.  The entire team is wonderful.  They are professional and extremely pleasant.  
Not only are the people great but the massage chairs and TVs are an added bonus, the office is always clean and tidy and you're sent appointment reminders.  

The reason I switched to Evergreen Dental (over 5 years ago) is because my former dental office didn't offer evening appointments and I was tired of taking time off work for appointments.  Also, when I arrive for my appointments at Evergreen Dental, I am taken in at my scheduled appointment time which is appreciated.  They are courteous and efficient and I am thankful to have such a great dental office now.My wife had a large piece of tooth that had broken off and there was a cavity in the tooth that was close to the root. Her dentist and his assistant worked tirelessly to repair the damaged tooth and we were immensely pleased with the results. I would definitely recommend Evergreen Dental.Very clean and comfortable (weird to say that about a dentists' office. Great spot, I've been so happy, I actually show up for my appointments! New owners.. New energy... Best part "" now serving Mango Lassi... It's yum yum... Very clean place...We love the Playbox!  It is a great spot for birthday parties! And we like that it is smaller it makes finding the kiddos easy! Free wifi and good coffee as well!Wonderful place to bring your kids. It's smaller then other playplaces, but you can always see your child. Nice sitting area for adults,coffee is really good. Prices are good and lots of healthy snack options for kids! Staff is exceptional! I was at the end of my rope trying to save my sons dog when Aileen Furey came to the rescue...

"Bought an F150 here recently. They make good promises to your face and don't follow through. 
1st- Gas Gauge isnt working and I discovered that the day I drove off the lot, they wont go good for fixing it

2nd- put in our bill of sale I wanted the missing hubcaps. Still waiting over a month later (yes ive been checking in)

3rd - Hubcaps are bent out and when I looked to decide I was going to replace them the techs put the wheel weights ON the hubcaps... Real S-M-R-T 

Don't waste your time here unless you're looking for that greasy-sleezy used car sales experienceI was Approved for financing!!! and I got the car I wanted plus tires!!!! Thank you Barry for you hard work! I know I was a pain in the Butt but hey at least I got your printer working again Barry was a great sales person! Even though we didn't get what we asked for an were approved the site down and talk with him was great! Even though the mix up happened I'd honesty have to say that they got us am approval pretty darn quickly for what we wanted! And Barry thanks for trying to help me find the yogurt bunny too :) ❤️ My Daughter loves it here! Great staff! Extremely pleased with the services offered by this team! I called day of and they managed to make it work to come to my house same day and they cleaned impeccably.

"My son goes to this daycare and we absolutely love it Arrived on time and was polite and all.
Though! heads up, I'm pretty sure this is a scammy driver who just has taxi stickers on his car and charged me 55$ for the drive to airport. When I asked about the flat rate, he said it was because I wasn't sharing the car with any one else. 
Also texted while drivingAmazing driver and excelent service was very helpfull getting luggage in the car and putting on the trolley at the airport.Booked my cab and when it arrived, car was clean and driver asked if we could pick up another passenger on the way to the airport. I was fine with this, despite the fact that it took longer to get to the airport, but he then wanted to charge us each $40 for a ride total of $80. I think this is unacceptable when the flat rate is $55, which we should have just split between the two riders. I expressed my concerns and he said the company wouldn’t let him charge less than $35 each or he would have to pay the difference out of pocket. I felt uncomfortable and scammed, whether by the company or driver, and will not be using this service again. Very unprofessional!",business

Impressive selection of organic food as well considering it's a supplement store. Look here first!Love this place! Very friendly, knowledgeable 
, passionate staff. The owner even gave me a vegan ice cream snack. :) 🍦🌱
I honestly love this place! They are great, my daughter loves it here she started at 8 months. All the ladies in the baby room are wonderful! Excellent service and quality work apparel, they will even special order. I love this place, they are a locally owned company that cares about it's customer. Any negative reviews on their services is highly questionable to me, every experience I've had has been great, going there for new boots today.Homie kept store open 10mins so I could pick up a proper surveyor vest. Got discount for specific company. All G. Friendly staff. Helpful. Wicked place. I'll head back to get a better look around.Great discount on some steel toed work sneakers!
They also serve giants. Scrumptious bread with exquisite toppings, mouth watering chicken and complementary soda pop (mostly coke). Enjoyable experience...

Most amazing is timely delivery. Pizza was ready before we reach and still hot.Only issue i have with this place is that sometimes they miss one or two items on an order, but they are always willing to fix any issues. Best pizza out there. Make sure to get a thick crust, and get it well done, as well as add oregano, and sweet garlic spices!!Great place to eat and very friendly staff. Pizza's were delicious. Definitely recommend!! Carol was extremely helpful, with great customer service. Couldn't be more thankful she was there to help myself and my colleagues with quality and efficient service. I definitely would recommend going to the Joseph Howe Location if you need anything completed with CAA.Very helpful staff. I relocated from Alberta to nova Scotia and needed to get car insurance and apartment insurance.  Rates were much cheaper than Alberta as well as other places I got quotes on. I highly recommend insurance of any kind from caa....no hastle insurance company.Helpful, friendly staff. Place is spacious and the International Driver's Licence issuing process was seamless and fast. Just ask if your looking for anything, they are really good at finding what you need.Great yacht supplies. Excellent staffWhat a great place. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff. Well stocked clothing and gear. The workers at this daycare are caring of the children. We have two children (grandchildren) 
Attending and are pleased with the program. I purchased a device from their store with an assurance that there was a 7-Day in store exchange policy in case of any defect. When using the device for the first time it was apparent that there was in fact a manufacturer's defect preventing the device from operating all together. I went to the store of the very next day looking for an exchange and was told that there is only one staff member able to accept exchanges and that I would have to wait an additional 4 days to discuss the matter. I needed a new device for the long weekend which is why I made the purchase on Thursday.

I was left no choice but to go to a different store to buy a working device. This is very poor customer service and I will take my business elsewhere moving forward and encourage everyone to do the same.

This is not the first issue I have had with the store. They sold me expired bunk juice knowingly and lied to my face about it. The juice in question was Vanilla sin and it was in glass bottles instead of the plastic. The manager indicated that the glass bottles were far cheaper than the plastic but that there was no difference between them. I had tried the vanilla sin in plastic before and enjoyed the flavor but the liquid in the glass containers was absolutely disgusting in each of the two bottles I purchased. I suspect that they knew these were very old otherwise I'm not sure why they would be less money. 

Not Good Guys.Love Mat. I think his name is the manager. Best guy around very very knowledgeable.. He's reason I keep go back. Amazing job great store.(Update the owner has replied to me and resolved the issue in a way that made me satisfied I will go back to give it 5 star review for the way it was handled )
I understand why this spot gets such a bad rep
I called in and asked if there's a started kit for the stlth I was told yes there is 
And I drove all the way there just to be told oh sorry we don't have it ...... Bad bad customer service 
Went down to Halifax cloud instead excellent service",business
